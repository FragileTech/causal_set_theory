    "\n",
    "In Einstein's General Relativity, gravity is not a force; it is the **curvature of spacetime**. The key mathematical object that describes this curvature at a point is the **Ricci Scalar, `R`**. The master equation for gravity, the Einstein-Hilbert action, is essentially the sum of `R` over all of spacetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** How can we possibly find a quantity like `R`, which describes smooth curvature, in a messy, random jumble of discrete dots?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** We use a clever trick involving a discrete wave operator, `B`. By applying this operator to the most boring field imaginable (a field of all ones), the operator doesn't return zero as you'd expect. Instead, the non-zero result it spits out is directly proportional to the spacetime curvature `R`! This is the central insight of this section.\n"
