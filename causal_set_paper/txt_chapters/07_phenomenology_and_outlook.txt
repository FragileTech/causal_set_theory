\section{Phenomenology} 
\label{sec:phen} 


While the deep realm of quantum gravity is extremely well shielded from experimental probes in the foreseeable future, it is possible that certain
{properties}  of quantum gravity  can ``leak'' into observationally accessible regimes. This is the reason for the push, in the last
couple of decades, for exploring quantum gravity phenomenology. Without a full theory of quantum gravity, of course
there is little hope that any phenomenology is entirely believable, since it requires assumptions about an
incomplete theory. Nevertheless, quantum gravity phenomenology can be  useful  in setting realistic bounds on
these leaked out properties, and hence constrain theories of quantum gravity, albeit weakly.  Models of quantum gravity
phenomenlogy moreover use distilled properties of the underlying theory to build reasonable
models that can be tested. Some of these properties are unique to a given approach.

In CST spacetime discreteness takes
a special form and brings with it a special type of  non-locality that can  affect observable physics. We have already
encountered the possibility of voids in Sect.~\ref{sec:cst} as well as the propagation of scalar fields from distance
sources in Sect.~\ref{sec:matter}. 
The continuum approximation of CST  is Lorentz invariant and consistent with stringent observational bounds as
summarised in \cite{li}.
In
addition, as suggested by \cite{swerves}, there is the possibility of generating very high energies particles through long time diffusion in
momentum space. This arises  from the randomness of CST  discreteness, which cause particles to ``swerve'',  or suddenly
change their momentum, 
as they traverse the causal set underlying our universe \citep{swervestwo,faypolarisation}.
This spacetime
Brownian motion was calculated in $\mink^d$ and  can be constrained by observations \citep{swerveconstraint}, but an
open question is how to extend the calculation  to our FRW universe. 

There have been some very interesting recent ideas by \cite{nonlocalqftfour} for testing CST type  non-locality  via its
effect on propagation in the continuum using the d'Alembertian operator. \cite{nonlocalfive}  have looked at the
associated quantum field theory which contain critical instabilities. These can be removed by modifying the
d'Alembertian, but the relationship to CST is unclear.  \cite{darkmatter}  have proposed a candidate for dark
matter as off-shell modes of the non-local CST  d'Alembertian. This is an exciting proposal and should be investigated
in more detail. 

We will not review these very interesting ideas on CST phenomenology here, except one, namely the prediction of
$\Lambda$.

\subsection{The 1987 prediction for $\Lambda$} 
\label{ssec:lambda}

One of the most outstanding questions in theoretical physics is understanding the origin of ``dark energy''  which
observationally has been seen to make up $\sim 70\%$ of the total energy of the universe. The current observational value
is  $\sim 2.888 \times 10^{-122}$ in Planck units. Quantum field theory predictions for dark energy interpreted as the
energy of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields on the other hand gives a huge value, perhaps as large as  $\sim 1$ in Planck units.  The gross
conflict with observation obviously implies that this cannot be the source of $\Lambda$.\footnote{On the other hand, it
  would be interesting to understand \emph{why} the back of the envelope quantum field theory calculation is not
  observationally relevant. Interesting insights into this question could come
  from a better understanding of the SJ vacuum in de~Sitter spacetime.}


In light of this conundrum, the CST prediction  for $\Lambda$  due to \cite{lambdaone} is startling in its simplicity and
accuracy, especially since it was made several years before the  {1998} observation.
One begins with the framework of unimodular gravity \citep{lambdatwo,unruhwald} in which the spacetime
volume element is fixed. 
$\Lambda$ then appears as a Lagrange multiplier in the action, with $\Lambda \int dV= \Lambda V ={\mathrm{constant}}$, for any finite spacetime region of volume $V$. In a canonical formulation of the
theory, therefore $\Lambda$ and $V$ are conjugate to each other, so that on quantisation there is an uncertainty relation 
\begin{equation}
\Delta V \Delta \Lambda \sim 1.
  \end{equation} 
Using the fact that $\Delta V $ is generated from Poisson fluctuations of the underlying causal set ensemble 
\begin{equation} 
  \Delta V \sim \sqrt{V}. 
\end{equation}
{ Assuming}  $\av{\Lambda}=0$, moreover, we see that 
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}\sim H^2 =\frac{1}{3}\rho_{\mathrm{critical}}
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hubble constant. If  $V$ is taken to be the  volume  of the visible universe, 
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda=\Delta \Lambda \sim 10^{-120}, 
\end{equation}
in Planck units. This is very close to the subsequently observed value of $\Lambda$! Importantly, the prediction also states that
that under these assumptions, $\Lambda$ always tracks the critical density and is hence ``everpresent''. 

This argument is general and requires three 
important ingredients: (i)  the assumption of unimodularity and hence the  conjugacy between $\Lambda$ and $V$, (ii) the
number to volume correspondence $V \sim n$ and (iii)  that there \emph{are}  fluctuations in $V$ which are  Poisson, with
$\delta V = \sqrt{V} \sim \sqrt{n}$. While (i) can be
motivated by a wide range of theories of quantum gravity, (ii) and (iii)  are both  \emph{distinctive} to causal set theory.  No other discrete approach to quantum gravity makes
the $n \sim V$ correspondence at a fundamental level and also  incorporates  Poisson
fluctuations kinematically in the continuum approximation. Quoting from \cite{lambdaone}, {``Fluctuations in $\Lambda$  arise as residual nonlocal quantum effects of
spacetime discreteness''}.   Interestingly, as shown by \cite{sorkinledl},  if spacetime admits large extra directions, then the contribution to $V$ is
very different and gives the wrong answer for $\Delta \Lambda$.   

Of course, an important question that arises in this quick calculation is  why we should assume that $\av{\Lambda}=0$.\footnote{In
  \cite{samsupurna}, a very striking analogy was made between   a fluctuating $\Lambda$ and the surface tension $T$ of  a
  fluid
  membrane. In addition, using the atomicity of the model, the mean value of $T$ was shown to be zero, with a suggestion
of how this might extend to  CST.} The answer to
this may well lie in the  full and as yet unknown quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, phenomenologically  this assumption leads to further predictions that can
already be tested. The first conclusion is that a fluctuating $\Lambda$ must violate conservation of the stress energy
tensor, and hence the Einstein field equations. 

In \cite{lambdathree}, a dynamical model for generating fluctuations of $\Lambda$ was constructed, starting with the flat
$k=0$ FRW spacetime. In order to accommodate a fluctuating $\Lambda$, one of the two Friedmann equations   
must be dropped.  In \cite{lambdathree}, the Friedmann equation
\begin{equation} 
3\biggl(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\biggr)^2= \rho + \rho_\Lambda 
\end{equation}
was retained,\footnote{Subsequently, more general ``mixed equation'' models were examined in \cite{eptwo}, which
  indicate that the results of \cite{lambdathree} are robust to these modifications.}  with  
\begin{equation}
  \rho_\Lambda =\Lambda, \qquad p_\Lambda= -\Lambda -\dot{\Lambda}/3H, 
 \end{equation} 
and  $\Lambda$ modelled as a stochastic function of $V$, such that
 \begin{equation}
   \Delta \Lambda \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}.
   \end{equation} 

More generally, $\Lambda$ can be thought of as the action $S$  per unit volume, which for causal sets  means that $\Lambda \sim S/V$.  A  very
   simple  stochastic dynamics is then generated by assuming that every element contributes $\pm \hbar$ to $S$, so that 
   \begin{equation}
     S=\sum_{\mathrm{elements}} \pm \hbar \Rightarrow S/\hbar \sim \pm \sqrt{N} \sim \pm \sqrt{V/l_p^4} \Rightarrow \Lambda\sim
     \pm \frac{\hbar /l_p^2}{\sqrt{V}} \,,  
\end{equation} 
 where we have equated the discreteness scale $l_c$ with the Planck length $l_p$. One then gets the integro-differential equations  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\frac{da}{a} &=&\sqrt{\frac{\rho+\Lambda}{3}}d\tau \nonumber \\ 
V d\Lambda &=& Vd(S/V)=dS-\Lambda \dot{V} d\tau \,, \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray} 
where
\begin{equation}
  V(\tau) = \frac{4\pi}{3} \int_0^t dt' a(t')^3 \biggl( \int_0^{t'} dt" \frac{1}{a(t")}\biggr)^3
  \end{equation} 
is the volume of the entire causal past of an event in the FRW spacetime.  
The stochastic equation is then generated as follows. At the $i^{\tth}$ step 
one has the variables $a_i$ (scale factor), $N_i,V_i,S_i $ and $ \Lambda_i$. The scale factor is updated using the
discrete  Friedmann equation  
$a_{i+1}=a_i+a_i\sqrt{\frac{\rho+\Lambda}{3}}(\tau_{i+1}-\tau_i)$, from which $V_i=V(\tau)$ can be calculated and thence 
$N_{i+1}=V_{i+1}/\ell^4$. The  action is then updated  via $S_{i+1}=S_i+ \alpha \, \, \xi\sqrt{N_{i+1}-N_i}$, where
$\quad\xi$ is a Gaussian random variable, with $\quad\Delta \xi = 1$, and $\alpha$ is a tunable free parameter which
controls the magnitude of the fluctuations.   Finally, $\Lambda_{i+1}=S_{i+1}/V_{i+1}$, with   $S_0=0$.  It was shown in
\cite{lambdathree} that in order to be consistent with astrophysical observations,  $0.01 < \alpha < 0.02$. The results of
simulations moreover suggest  that $\Lambda$ is \emph{``everpresent''} and tracks the energy density of the universe.

This model assumes spatial homogeneity and it is important to check how inhomogeneities affect these results.  In
\cite{barrow} and \cite{zuntz},  inhomogeneities were modelled by taking $\Lambda(x^\mu)$, such that $\Delta \Lambda(x)$ is
dependent only on $\Lambda(y)$ for $y \in J^-(x)$.  This would mean that well separated patches in the CMB sky would
contain uncorrelated fluctuations in $\Omega_\Lambda$, which in turn are strongly constrained to $< 10^{-6}$ by 
observations and hence insufficient to account for $\Lambda$.  In \cite{lambdathree} and \cite{recentlambda}, it was suggested that  quantum Bell
correlations may be a possible way to induce correlations in the CMB sky. However, incorporating inhomogeneities into the
dynamics in a systematic way remains  an
important open question. 

In \cite{recentlambda}, a phenomenological model was adopted which uses the homogeneous temporal fluctuations in $\Lambda$ to model a  quintessence type spatially inhomogeneous scalar field with a potential term
that varies   from realisation to realisation. Using MCMC methods to sample  the cosmological parameter space, and
generate different stochastic realisations, it was shown  that  these CST inspired models agrees
with the observations as well as $\Lambda CDM$ models and in fact does better for the   Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)
measurements.  The very extensive and detailed analysis of \cite{recentlambda} sets the stage for direct comparisons
with future observations and heralds an exciting phase of  quantum gravity phenomenology.  

\section{Outlook} 
\label{sec:outlook}

CST has come a long way in the last three decades, despite the fact that there are only a few  practitioners who have been able
to dedicate their time to it. Over the last
decade, in particular, there has been a growth of interest with inputs from the wider quantum gravity community. 
This is  heartening, since an  extensive exploration of the theory is required in order to make significant progress. It
is our hope  that this review will spark the interest of the larger quantum gravity  community, and continue what has
been a productive dialogue. 

We have in this review touched upon several open questions, many  of which are challenging but some of which are
straightforward to carry out. We will not summarise these but just pick two that are of utmost importance. One is the
the pursuit of CST-inspired inhomogeneous models of fluctuating $\Lambda$ which can be tested against the most recent observations. The second, on the other side of the quantum gravity spectrum, is the construction from first
principles of a viable quantum dynamics for causal sets. Between these two ends lie myriad interesting
questions. We invite you to join us.
