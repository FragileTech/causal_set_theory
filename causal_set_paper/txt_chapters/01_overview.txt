\section{Overview} 

In this review,  causal set theory (CST) refers to the
specific proposal made by
Bombelli, Lee, Meyer and Sorkin (BLMS) in their 1987 paper
\citep{blms}.  In CST, the space of Lorentzian geometries is  replaced by the set of  locally finite posets, or
\emph{causal sets}.   These causal sets encode  the
twin principles of causality and discreteness. In the continuum approximation 
of CST, where elements of the causal set 
set represent spacetime events, the order relation on the
causal set   corresponds to the spacetime causal order and the  cardinality of an ``order interval''  to the spacetime volume 
of the associated causal interval.  


This review is intended as a semi-pedagogical 
introduction to CST. The aim  is to give a broad survey of the
main results and open questions and  to direct the reader
to some of the many interesting open research problems in CST, some of which are
accessible even to the beginner.

We begin in
Sect.~\ref{sec:history} with a historical perspective 
on the ideas behind  CST. The
twin principles of discreteness and causality at the heart of
CST have both been proposed -- sometimes independently and sometimes together -- starting with
\cite{Riemann} and \cite{robbone,robbtwo},  and somewhat later by \cite{zeeman,kp,finkelstein,hemion} and \cite{myrheim}, 
culminating in the CST proposal of BLMS \citep{blms}. 
 The continuum approximation of CST is an implementation of a deep
result in Lorentzian geometry due to \cite{hkm}
and its generalisation by \cite{malament}, which states that the causal structure determines the conformal geometry of a future and past distinguishing
causal spacetime. In following this
history, the discussion will be necessarily somewhat technical. For those unfamiliar with the terminology of causal
structure we point to standard texts \citep{HE,BE,Wald,penrose}.

In Sect.~\ref{sec:cst}, we state the 
 CST proposal and describe its continuum approximation, in which spacetime causality is equivalent to the order relation
 and finite spacetime volumes to cardinality. Not all causal sets have a continuum approximation -- in fact we will see
 that most do not. Those that do are referred to as  \emph{manifold-like}. Important to CST is its
 ``Hauptvermutung'' or fundamental conjecture, which roughly states that a 
 manifold-like causal set is equivalent to the  continuum spacetime, modulo differences up to the discreteness scale. Much of the discussion on the Hauptvermutung is centered on
 the question of how to estimate the 
 closeness of Lorentzian manifolds or more generally,  causal sets. While there is no full proof of the  conjecture, there
 is growing body of  evidence in its favour as we will see in Sect.~\ref{sec:kinematics}. An important outcome of CST
 discreteness in the continuum approximation 
 is that it does not violate Lorentz invariance as shown in an elegant theorem by \cite{bomhensor}. Because of the centrality of this result we review this construction in some
 detail. The combination of discreteness and Lorentz invariance moreover gives rise to an inherent and characteristic
 non-locality, which distinguishes CST from other discrete approaches. Following \cite{lambdatwo}, we then discuss
 how the twin principles behind CST force us to take  certain ``forks in the road'' to quantum gravity.  


We present some of the key developments in  CST in Sects.~\ref{sec:kinematics}, \ref{sec:matter} and \ref{sec:dynamics}. We
begin with the kinematical structure of theory and the program of ``geometric reconstruction'' in Sect.~\ref{sec:kinematics}. Here, the aim
is to reconstruct manifold invariants from  \emph{order invariants}  in a manifold-like causal set. These are functions on
the causal set that are independent of the labelling or ordering of the elements in the causal set.    
Finding the appropriate order invariants that correspond to manifold invariants can be challenging, since there is little in the mathematics
literature which correlates  order theory to  Lorentzian geometry via the CST continuum approximation. 
Extracting such invariants requires new technical tools and insights sometimes requiring a rethink of familiar aspects
of continuum Lorentzian geometry. We  will describe some of the progress made in this direction over the years 
\citep{myrheim,bg,meyer,bommeyer,bomthesis,reid,homology,rw,sorkinnonlocal,bd,dionthesis,gaussbonnet,intervals,rss,bdjs,tlbdry,bomemad,esv}. The 
correlation between order invariants and manifold invariants  in the continuum approximation lends support for the
Hauptvermutung and simultaneously establishes weaker, observable-dependent versions of the conjecture.

Somewhere between dynamics and kinematics is the study of quantum fields on
manifold-like causal sets, which we describe in Sect.~\ref{sec:matter}. The simplest system is free
scalar field theory on a causal set approximated by $d$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime $\mink^d$. Because causal sets do not admit a natural Hamiltonian
framework, a fully covariant construction is required to obtain the quantum field theory vacuum. A natural starting
point is the advanced and retarded Green functions
for a free scalar field theory since  it is defined using the causal structure of the spacetime. The explicit form for
these Green functions were found for causal sets approximated by $\mink^d$ for $d=2,4$ 
\citep{daughton,johnston,johnstonthesis} as well as  de~Sitter spacetime \citep{dsx}.  In trying to find a quantisation scheme on the causal
set without reference to the continuum, 
\cite{johnstontwo} found a novel covariant definition of the discrete scalar field vacuum, starting from the covariantly
defined Peierls' bracket formulation of quantum field theory. Subsequently 
\cite{sorkinsj} showed that the construction is also valid in the continuum, and can be used to give an alternative
definition of the quantum field theory vacuum. This  \emph{Sorkin--Johnston (SJ) vacuum} provides a new 
insight into quantum field theory and  has stimulated the interest
of the algebraic field theory community \citep{fv12,bf14,fewsterart}. The SJ vacuum has also been used to calculate Sorkin's spacetime
entanglement entropy (SSEE) \citep{bklsEE,sorkinEE} in a causal set \citep{yasamaneecont,causetee}. The calculation in $d=2$ is 
surprising since it gives rise to a volume law rather than an area law. What this means for causal set entanglement
entropy is still an open question. 

In Sect.~\ref{sec:dynamics}, we describe the CST approach to quantum
dynamics, which roughly follows two directions.
The first, is based on ``first principles'', where one starts with a general set of
axioms which respect microscopic covariance and causality. An important
class of such theories is the set of Markovian \emph{classical sequential growth} (CSG)  models of Rideout and Sorkin
\citep{csg,csgtwo,csgrg,davidthesis,rv}, which we will describe in some detail. The dynamical framework finds a natural
expression in terms of measure theory,
with the classical covariant observables represented by a covariant event algebra $\fA$ over the sample space $\Omega_g$ of past finite
causal sets \citep{observables,observablesds}. One of the main questions in CST dynamics is whether the overwhelming entropic
presence of the \emph{Kleitman--Rothschild (KR)} posets in $\Omega_g$ can be overcome by the dynamics \citep{kr}. These KR posets are
highly  non-manifold-like and ``static'', with just three ``moments of time''. Hence, if the continuum approximation is
to emerge in the classical limit of the theory, then the entropic contribution  from the KR posets should be suppressed
by the dynamics in this limit.  In the CSG models, 
the typical causal sets generated are  very ``tall'' with countable rather than finite moments  of time and, though not
quite manifold-like, are very
unlike the KR posets or even the subleading entropic contributions from non-manifold-like causal sets
\cite{dharone,dhartwo}.
The CSG models have generated some interest in the mathematics community, and new mathematical tools are now being used
to study the asymptotic structure of the theory \citep{grnick,gmone,gmtwo,grahammalwina}. 


In CST, the appropriate route to quantisation is via the quantum measure or decoherence functional defined
in the double-path integral formulation \citep{qmeasureone,qmeasuretwo,sorkinqmeasure}. In the quantum versions of the
CSG (\emph{quantum sequential growth} or QSG) models the transition probabilities of CSG are replaced
by the decoherence functional. While
covariance can be easily imposed, a quantum version of microscopic causality is still missing \citep{joecausality}.
Another indication of the non-triviality of quantisation comes from a prosaic 
generalisation of transitive percolation, which is the simplest of the CSG models. In this ``complex percolation''  
dynamics the quantum measure does not
extend to the full algebra of observables which is an impediment to the construction of 
covariant quantum observables \citep{djs}. This can  be somewhat alleviated by taking a physically motivated approach to
measure theory \citep{ec}. An important future direction is to
construct  covariant observables in a wider class of quantum dynamics and look for a quantum version of coupling
constant renormalisation.   

Whatever the ultimate quantum dynamics  however, little sense can be
made of the theory without a fully developed quantum interpretation for closed systems, essential to quantum gravity. Sorkin's co-event interpretation
\citep{sorkinalogic,kochenspecker} provides a promising avenue based on the quantum measure approach. While a discussion
of this is outside of the scope of the present work, one can use the broader ``principle of preclusion'', i.e., that sets of zero quantum measure do not
occur\citep{sorkinalogic,kochenspecker}, to make a limited set of  predictions in complex percolation ({\it Sorkin and Surya, work in progress}).  



The second approach to quantisation is more pragmatic, and uses the continuum inspired path integral formulation of
quantum gravity for causal sets. 
Here, the path integral is replaced by a sum over the sample space $\Omega$ of causal sets, using the \emph{Benincasa--Dowker} (BD) action, which limits to  the  Einstein--Hilbert action \citep{bd}. This can be viewed as an
effective, continuum-like dynamics, arising from the more fundamental dynamics described above. A recent
analytic calculation in \cite{carliploomis} showed that a sub-dominant 
class of non-manifold-like causal sets, the bilayer posets, are suppressed in the path integral when using the BD
action, under certain dimension dependent conditions satisfied by the parameter space. This gives hope that an 
effective dynamics might be able to overcome the entropy of the non-manifold-like causal sets. 

 
In \cite{2dqg}, \cite{2dhh}, and \cite{fss}, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were used for a dimensionally restricted sample space
$\Omega_{2d}$ of 2-orders, which corresponds to topologically trivial $d=2$ causal set quantum gravity. 
The quantum partition function over causal sets can be rendered into a statistical partition function via an analytic
continuation of a  ``temperature'' parameter, while retaining  the Lorentzian character of the theory. This theory
exhibits a first order phase transition \citep{2dqg,fss} between a manifold-like phase and a layered, non-manifold-like
one. MCMC methods have also been used to examine the sample space $\Omega_n$ of $n$-element causal sets and to estimate the
onset of asymptotia, characterised by 
the dominance of the KR posets \citep{onset}. These techniques have recently  been extended to topologically non-trivial
$d=2$ and $d=3$ CST ({\it Cunningham and Surya, work in progress}). While this approach gives us expectation values of covariant observables
which allows for a straightforward interpretation, relating it to the complex or quantum partition function is
non-trivial and an open problem. 

In Sect.~\ref{sec:phen}, we describe in brief some of the exciting
phenomenology that comes out of the \emph{kinematical} structure of
causal sets. This includes the momentum space diffusion coming from CST
discreteness (``swerves'') \citep{swerves} and the effects of non-locality on quantum field theory \citep{sorkinnonlocal}, which includes a 
recent proposal for dark matter \citep{darkmatter}. Of these, the most striking is the 1987 prediction of
Sorkin for the value of the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ \citep{lambdaone,lambdatwo}. While the original argument was a kinematic estimate, subsequently dynamical
models of fluctuating $\Lambda$ were examined \citep{lambdathree,eptwo,recentlambda} and have been compared with recent observations
\citep{recentlambda}. This is an exciting future direction of research in CST which interfaces intimately with
observation. We conclude with a brief outlook for CST in Sect.~\ref{sec:outlook}.

Finally, since this is an extensive review, to assist the reader  we have made a  list of some of the key definitions,
as well as the abbreviations  in Appendix \ref{sec:aone}.  

As is true of all other approaches to quantum gravity, CST
is not as yet a complete theory. Some of the challenges faced are universal to quantum gravity as a whole, while
others are specific to the approach. Although we have developed a reasonably good grasp of the 
kinematical structure of CST and some progress has been made in the construction of effective quantum dynamics, CST still lacks a
satisfactory quantum dynamics built from first principles. Progress in this direction is therefore very important for
the future of the program.  From a broader perspective, it is the opinion of this author that a deeper understanding of CST will help provide key insights into the nature of quantum
gravity from a fully Lorentzian, causal perspective, whatever ultimate shape the final theory takes. 

It is not possible for this review to be truly complete. The hope is that the interested reader will use it 
as a springboard to the existing literature. Several older reviews  exist with differing emphasis  
\citep{lambdaone,valdivia,joereviewone,fayreview, lightlinks, fayreview, joereviewtwo,walldenreview}, some of which 
have an in depth discussion of the conceptual underpinnings of CST.  The
focus of the current review is to provide as cohesive an account of the program as possible, so as to be
useful to a starting researcher in the field. For more technical details, the reader is urged to look at the original
references.
