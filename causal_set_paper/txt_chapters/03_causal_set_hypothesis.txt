\section{The causal set hypothesis}
\label{sec:cst} 

     
We begin with the definition of a causal set: \\

\noindent {\bf Definition:}  A set $C$ with an order relation $\prec$ is a \emph{causal set}  if it is 
\begin{enumerate}  
\item \emph{Acyclic}: $x\prec y$ and $y \prec x $ $\Rightarrow x=y$, $\forall
  x,y \in C$ 
\item \emph{Transitive}: $x\prec y$ and $y \prec z $ $\Rightarrow x \prec z$, $\forall
  x,y,z \in C$ 
\item \emph{Locally finite}:  $\forall x,y \in C$, $|\cAlex[x,y]|< \infty$, where $\cAlex[x,y]\equiv \fut(x) \cap \past(y)$ \,,  
\end{enumerate} 
where $|.|$ denotes the cardinality of the set, and\footnote{These are  the \emph{exclusive} future and past sets since
  they do not include the element itself.} 
\begin{eqnarray}  
\fut(x) &\equiv&\{w \in C| x \prec w, x \neq w\} \nn \\ 
  \past(x) &\equiv&\{w \in C| w \prec x, x \neq w \}.
 \label{eq:futpast}                    
\end{eqnarray}
We refer to $\cAlex[x,y]$ as an \emph{order interval}, in analogy with the  Alexandrov interval in the continuum. 
The acyclic and transitive conditions together define a partially
ordered set or poset, while the  condition of local finiteness
encodes discreteness.  
\begin{figure}[ht]

    relation $\prec$ in any Lorentzian  spacetime.}

\end{figure}



\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering \resizebox{3.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{causalset}}
\caption{The \emph{Hasse diagrams} of some simple finite cardinality causal sets. Only the nearest neighbour
    relations or \emph{links} are depicted. The remaining relations are deduced from transitivity.}
\label{transitivity.fig}
\end{figure}

The content of the HKMM theorem can be summarised in the statement:
\begin{equation} 
\mathrm{Causal\, \, Structure + Volume\,\, Element = Lorentzian \, \, Geometry},     
\end{equation}
which lends itself to a discrete rendition, dubbed  
the ``CST slogan'': 
\begin{equation} 
\mathrm{Order + Number \sim Lorentzian\,\, Geometry }.   
\label{ordernumber} 
\end{equation}
One  therefore assumes a fundamental correspondence between the number of elements in a region of the
  causal set and the continuum volume element that it represents. The condition of local finiteness means that all
  order intervals  in the causal set are of finite cardinality and hence correspond in the continuum to
  finite volume. This CST slogan captures  the essence of the (yet to be specified)  continuum approximation of a {manifold-like }   causal set, which we denote by $C \sim (M,g)$. 
While the continuum causal structure gives the continuum conformal geometry  via the HKMM theorem, the  discrete  causal
structure represented by the underlying causal set is conjectured to approximate  the entire spacetime geometry. Thus,  discreteness supplies the missing conformal factor, or the missing $\left(1/10\right)^{\mathrm{th}}$ of the metric, in $d=4$. 



Motivated thus, CST makes the following  radical proposal \citep{blms}:  
\begin{enumerate}    
\item \label{qgcst} Quantum gravity is a quantum theory of causal sets. 
\item  \label{ca} 
A continuum spacetime $(M,g)$ is an approximation of an underlying causal set $C \sim (M,g)$, where  
\begin{enumerate}  
\item  \label{order} Order $\sim $ Causal Order 
\item  \label{number} Number $\sim $ Spacetime Volume 
\end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate} 



In CST, the {kinematical} space of $d=4$ continuum spacetime geometries or histories is replaced with a \emph{
  sample space} $\Omega$ of causal sets.  Thus,  discreteness is viewed not only as a tool for regulating the
continuum, but as a fundamental feature of quantum spacetime. $\Omega$ includes causal sets that
have no continuum counterpart, i.e., they cannot be related via Conditions (\ref{order})  and
(\ref{number}) to \emph{any}  continuum spacetime in any dimension. These non-manifold-like causal sets are expected to
play an important role in the deep quantum regime. In order to make this precise we need to define what it means for a
causal set to be manifold-like, i.e., to make precise the relation ``$C \sim (M,g)$''.  


Before doing so, it is important to understand the need for a continuum approximation at all.  Without it, Condition
(\ref{qgcst}) yields  \emph{any}  quantum theory of locally finite posets: one then has the full freedom of choosing any poset calculus to construct
a quantum dynamics, without need to connect with the continuum.   Examples of such poset approaches to quantum gravity
include those by  \cite{finkelstein} and \cite{hemion}, and more recently \cite{lee}. What distinguishes CST from
these approaches is the critical role played by both causality and discrete covariance which informs the choice of the
dynamics as well the physical observables.  In particular, condition (\ref{ca}) is the requirement  that in the continuum approximation these observables should
correspond to appropriate continuum topological and geometric covariant observables. 



What do we mean by the \emph{continuum approximation}   Condition (\ref{ca})?  We begin to answer this  by looking
for the underlying causal set of a  causal spacetime $(M,g)$.  A useful analogy to keep in mind  is that of a
macroscopic  fluid, for example a glass of water.  Here, there are a multitude of  molecular-level configurations
corresponding to the same macroscopic state.  Similarly, we expect there to be a multitude of  causal sets  approximated by the same
spacetime $(M,g)$. And,  just as the set of allowed microstates of the glass of
water depends on the molecular size, the causal set microstate depends on the \emph{discreteness scale $V_c$}, which is
a fundamental spacetime volume cut-off.\footnote{The most obvious choice for $V_c$ is the Planck volume, but we will not
  require it at this stage.}

Since the causal set $C$ approximating $(M,g)$ is locally finite,  it represents a proper subset of the event-set $M$.
An   \emph{  embedding} is  the injective map
\begin{equation} \Phi:C \hookrightarrow (M,g), \quad x \prec_C y \Leftrightarrow \Phi(x) \prec_M \Phi(y),
\end{equation} 
 where $\prec_{C} $ and $\prec_M$ denote  the order relations in $C $ and $ M$ respectively.  Not every causal set can
 be embedded into a given spacetime $(M,g)$. Moreover, even if an embedding exists, this is not sufficient to ensure
 that $C \sim (M,g)$ since only Condition (\ref{order})  is satisfied.  In addition to correlate the cardinality
 of the causal set with the spacetime volume element, Condition (\ref{number}),   the embeddings must also be
 \emph{uniform}  with respect
 to the spacetime volume measure of   $(M,g)$.  A causal set  is said to approximate a spacetime $C \sim (M,g)$ at \emph{density}
 $\rc=V_c^{-1}$ if there exists    
 a \emph{faithful embedding} 
 \begin{equation}
   \Phi: C \hookrightarrow M, \quad \Phi(C) \mathrm{\ is \ a \ uniform \ distribution \ in \ }(M,g) \mathrm{\ at \
     density \ } \rho_c, 
 \end{equation}
 where by \emph{uniform} we mean with respect to the spacetime volume measure of   $(M,g)$. 
 
 

%\ref{number} 

The uniform distribution at density $\rho_c$ ensures that  every finite spacetime volume $V$ is represented
by  a finite number of elements $n \sim \rho_c V $ in the causal set.  It is natural to make these finite spacetime regions
causally convex, so that they can be constructed from unions of Alexandrov intervals $\Alex[p,q] $ in $(M,g)$. 
%$\equiv J^+(p) \cap J^-(q)$
 However,  we must
ensure covariance, since the goal is to be able to recover the approximate covariant spacetime geometry.  This is why 
$\Phi(C)$ is required to be uniformly distributed in $(M,g)$ with respect to the spacetime volume measure. It is obvious
that a ``regular'' lattice cannot do the job since it is  not  regular in all frames or coordinate systems. Hence  it is not
possible to consistently  assign $n \sim \rho_c V$ to such lattices (see Fig.~{\ref{lattice.fig}}).

  transforms into the ``stretched''  lattice on the right under a boost. The $n \sim \rho_cV$ correspondence cannot be
  implemented as seen from  the example of the Alexandrov interval, which  contains $n=7$ lattice points in the lattice
  in the left but is empty after a boost.}

  \end{figure}
 


The issue of symmetry breaking is of course obvious even in Euclidean space. Any regular discretisation breaks the rotational
and translational  symmetry of the continuum. In the  lattice calculations for 
QCD, these symmetries are restored only  in the continuum limit, but 
are broken as long as the discreteness persists.  In \cite{tdlee} it was suggested
that symmetry can be restored in a  randomly generated  lattice where there lattice points are uniformly distributed via
a Poisson process. This has the advantage of not picking any preferred direction and hence not explicitly breaking
symmetry, at least on average. We will discuss this point in greater detail further on.  

Set in the context of spacetime, the Poisson distribution is a natural choice for $\Phi(C)$, with the probability of finding $n$ elements in a
spacetime region of volume $v$  given by 
\begin{equation} 
P_v(n)=\frac{(\rc v)^n}{n!}\exp^{-\rc v}.  
\label{eq:poisson} 
\end{equation} 
This means that on the \emph{average}
\begin{equation} 
\av{\bbn}=\rc v, 
\end{equation}  
where $\bn$ is the random variable associated with the random causal set $\Phi(C)$.   
This distribution then gives us the covariantly defined $n \sim  \rc V$ correspondence we seek.\footnote{Since $\Phi(C)$ is a random
  causal set, any function of ${\mathbf F}: C \rightarrow \re $ is therefore a random variable.} 

In a \emph{Poisson sprinkling} into a
spacetime $(M,g)$ at density $\rho_c$ one selects points in $(M,g)$ uniformly at random and imposes a partial ordering on these elements via the induced spacetime causality relation.  Starting from $(M,g)$, we can then
obtain an ensemble of ``microstates'' or   causal sets, which we denote by   $\cC(M,\rc)$,  via  the Poisson sprinkling.\footnote{$\cC(M,\rc)$
  explicitly depends on the spacetime metric $g$, which we have suppressed for brevity of notation.} Each causal set thus obtained is a
\emph{realisation}, while any ``averaging'' is done over the whole ensemble.

We say that a causal set $C$ is approximated by a spacetime $(M,g)$ if $C$ can be
obtained from  $(M,g)$ via  a high probability Poisson sprinkling. Conversely, for every  $C \in \cC(M,\rc)$  there is a natural embedding map
\begin{equation}
\Phi: C \hookrightarrow  M \,,  
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(C)$ is a particular realisation in $\cC(M,\rc)$. In Fig.~\ref{causalset.fig}, we show a causal set 
obtained by Poisson sprinkling into $d=2$ de Sitter spacetime.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering \resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{hype.png}}
\caption{A Poisson sprinkling into a portion of 2d de Sitter spacetime embedded in $\mink^3$. The  relations on the elements are deduced from the causal structure of  $\mink^3$.}
\label{causalset.fig}
\end{figure}


That there is a fundamental discrete randomness even \emph{kinematically}  is not always easy for a newcomer to CST to come to terms with.  Not only
does CST posit a fundamental  discreteness,  it also requires it to be probabilistic. Thus, even before coming to 
quantum probabilities, CST makes us work with a  classical, stochastic discrete geometry.  

Let us state some obvious, but important aspects of Eq.~(\ref{eq:poisson}). Let $\Phi: C \hookrightarrow  (M,g)$ be a faithful embedding at density $\rho_c$.  While the set of all finite
volume regions\footnote{We assume that these are always causally convex.}   $v$ possess {on average}  $\av{\bn}=\rho_c
v$ elements of $C$,\footnote{Henceforth we will
  identify $\Phi(C)$ with $C$, whenever $\Phi$ is a faithful embedding.} the  Poisson fluctuations are given by  $\delta n =\sqrt{n}$. 
Thus, it is possible that  the region contains no elements at all, i.e., there is a ``void''.   An important
question to ask is how large a void is allowed, since  a  sufficiently large void
would have an obvious  effect on our macroscopic perception of a
continuum. If  spacetime is unbounded, as it is in  Minkowski spacetime,
the probability for the existence of a void of \emph{any} size is one.  Can this be compatible at all with the idea of an
emergent continuum in which the classical world can exist,  unperturbed by the vagaries of quantum gravity? 

The presence of a macroscopic void means that the continuum approximation is not realised in this region. A prediction
of CST is then that  the emergent continuum regions of spacetime are 
bounded both spatially and temporally, even if the underlying causal set is itself ``unbounded'' or countable. Thus, a continuum universe is not
viable forever. However, since the current phase of the observable universe \emph{does} have a continuum realisation one
has to ask whether this is compatible with CST discretisation.  In \cite{swerves} the
probability for there to be  at least one  nuclear size void  $ \sim 10^{-60}m^4 $ was calculated in a region of Minkowski spacetime
which is  the size of our present universe.  Using general considerations they found that the probability is of order $ 10^{84}
\times 10^{168} \times e^{-{10^{72}}}$, which is an absurdly small number!  Thus, CST poses no phenomenological inconsistency in
this regard. 

An example of a manifold-like causal set $C$ which is obtained via a Poisson sprinkling into a
2d causal diamond is shown in Fig.~\ref{2drandom.fig}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering \resizebox{3in}{!}  {\includegraphics[angle=45]{finalset_nice_random}}
\caption{A \emph{Hasse diagram}  of a causal set that faithfully embeds into a causal diamond in $\mink^2$. In a Hasse diagram
  only the nearest neighbour relations or \emph{links} are shown. The remaining relations follow by transitivity.}
\label{2drandom.fig}
\end{figure}
A striking feature of the resulting graph is that there is a high degree of connectivity. In the
 \emph{Hasse diagram} of Fig.~\ref{2drandom.fig} only the nearest neighbour relations or {links} are depicted with the remaining relations following from
 transitivity.  $e \prec e' \in C$  is said to be  a  \emph{link} if   $\nexists \, \, e''\in C$  
such 
 that $e''\neq e,e'$ and $e\prec e''\prec e'$.    In 
 a  causal set that is obtained from a Poisson sprinkling, the \emph{valency}, i.e., the number of nearest neighbours or
 links from any given element  is typically very large. This is an important feature of continuum
 like causal sets and results from the fact that the elements of $C$ are uniformly distributed in $(M,g)$.  For a given
 element $e \in C$, the
 probability of an event $x \succ e $ to 
be a link is equal to the probability that the Alexandrov interval $\Alex[e,x]$ does not contain any
elements of $C$. Since 
\begin{equation} 
P_V(0)=e^{-\rho_c V},  
\end{equation}  
the probability is significant only when $V \sim V_c$. As shown in  Fig.~\ref{valency.fig}, in  $\mink^d$, the set of events within a
proper time $\propto (V)^{1/d}$ to the future (or past) of a point $p$ lies in the region between the future light cone and the
hyperboloid $-t^2+\Sigma_i x_i^2 \propto (V)^{2/d}$, with $t>0$. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering {\resizebox{3.5in}{!}{\includegraphics{Nonlocal}}}
\caption{The \emph{valency} or number of nearest neighbours  of an element in a causal set obtained from a Poisson sprinkling into $\mink^2$ is infinite.}
\label{valency.fig}
\end{figure}
Up to fluctuations, therefore,  most of the future links to $e$ lie within the hyperboloid with $V=V_c \pm \sqrt{V_c}$. This is a  non-compact, infinite volume
region and hence the number of future links to $e$ is (almost surely) infinite.   Since linked elements  are the nearest
neighbours of $e$, this means the valency of 
 the graph $C$ is infinite. It is this feature of manifold-like causal sets which gives rise to a characteristic  
``non-locality'',  and   plays a critical  role in the continuum approximation of CST, time and again.

The Poisson distribution is not the only choice for a uniform distribution.
A pertinent question is whether a different choice of distribution is possible, which would 
lead to a different manifestation of the continuum approximation.   In \cite{aspoisson}, this question was addressed in
some detail.  Let $C \sim (M,g)$  at density $\rc$.  Consider $k$ non-overlapping Alexandrov intervals of
volume $V$ in $(M,g)$. Since $C$ is uniformly  distributed,  $\av{\bn} = \rho_c V$. The most  optimal choice of
distribution, is also  one in which the fluctuations $\delta \bn/\av{\bn}=\sqrt{\av{(\bn-\av{\bn})^2}}/{\av{\bn}}$ are minimised. This ensures
that $C$ is as close to the continuum as possible. For the Poisson distribution $\delta \bn/\av{\bn} = 1/\sqrt{\av{\bn}} = 1/\sqrt{\rho_c V}$.  Is this as good as it
gets? It was shown that for $d>2$,  and under certain further technical assumptions, the Poisson distribution indeed
does the best job. Strengthening these results is important as it can improve our understanding of  the continuum approximation. 


\subsection{The Hauptvermutung or fundamental conjecture of CST} 
\label{ssec:haupt} 

An important question is the uniqueness of  the continuum approximation associated to  a causal set $C$.  Can a given
$C$ be faithfully embedded at density $\rho_c$  into two different spacetimes,
$(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$?  We expect that this is the case  if $(M,g) $ and $ (M',g')$ differ
on scales  smaller than 
$\rho_c$, or that they are, in an appropriate sense, ``close'' $(M,g) \sim (M',g')$.   Let us assume that a causal set \emph{can} be identified with two macroscopically distinct spacetimes at the same density
$\rho_c$.  Should this be interpreted as a hidden duality between these spacetimes, as is the case for example for isospectral manifolds
or mirror manifolds in string theory \citep{string}?  The answer is clearly in the negative, since the aim of the CST
continuum approximation is to ensure that $C$ contains \emph{all} the information
in $(M,g)$ at scales above $\rho_c^{-1}$. Macroscopic non-uniqueness would therefore mean that the intent of
the CST  continuum approximation is \emph{not}  satisfied. 

We thus state the fundamental conjecture of CST: 

\textit{\textbf{The Hauptvermutung of CST:}  $C$ can  be faithfully embedded at density $\rho_c$  into two distinct spacetimes,
$(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$  iff  they are approximately isometric.}    

By an \emph{approximate  isometry }, $(M,g) \sim (M',g')$ at density $\rc$, we mean that $(M,g)$ and $ (M',g')$ differ only at scales smaller
 than $\rho_c$.  Defining such an isometry  rigorously is challenging, but concrete proposals have been made by 
 \cite{bomclose,noldusone,noldustwo,bomnoldus,bomnoldustwo},  en route to a full proof of the conjecture. Because of the
 technical nature of these results, we  will discuss it only very briefly in the next
 section, and  instead use the above intuitive and functional definition of closeness. 

 Condition (\ref{qgcst}) tells us that the kinematic space of Lorentzian geometries must be replaced by a \emph{sample
   space }  $\Omega$ of causal sets.  Let $\Omega$ be the set of all 
countable causal sets and $\contg$ the set of all possible Lorentzian geometries,  in all dimensions.  If $\sim$ denotes
the approximate isometry at a given $\rc$, as  discussed above, the quotient
space $\contg/\!\!\sim$ corresponds to the set of all continuum-like causal sets $\Omega_{cont}\subset \Omega$ at that $\rc$.  Thus,
causal sets in 
$\Omega$  correspond to Lorentzian geometries of  \emph{all} dimensions!  Couched this way, we see that   CST dynamics
has the daunting task of not only obtaining manifold-like causal sets in the classical limit, but also ones that have dimension $d=4$.  

As mentioned in the  introduction, the sample space of $n$ element causal sets $\Omega_n$ is dominated by the KR posets
depicted in Fig.~\ref{kr.fig} and are hence very non-manifold-like    \citep{kr}. A KR poset has   three ``layers'' (or abstract ``moments of
time''),  with roughly $n/4$ elements in the bottom and top layer and such that each  element  in the bottom
layer is related to roughly half those in the  middle layer, and similarly each element  in the top layer is related to
roughly half those in the middle layer.  The number of  KR posets grows as $\sim 2^{{n^2}/{4}}$ and hence must play a role in the
deep quantum regime. Since they are non-manifold-like  they pose  a challenge to the dynamics, which must overcome
their entropic dominance in the classical  limit of the theory.  Even if the entropy from these KR  posets is
  suppressed by an appropriate choice of dynamics, however, there is a sub-dominant hierarchy of non-manifold-like posets (also layered)
  which also need to be 
  reckoned with  \citep{dharone,dhartwo,pst}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{KR}
\caption{A Kleitman--Rothschild or KR poset.}
\label{kr.fig}
\end{figure} 



Closely tied to the continuum approximation  is  the notion of ``coarse graining''. Given a spacetime $(M,g)$ the
set $\cC(M,\rc)$ can be obtained for different values of $\rc$.  Given a causal set $C$ which faithfully embeds into $(M,g)$ at $\rc$, 
one can then \emph{coarse grain} it to a smaller subcausal set  $C' \subset C$  which faithfully embeds into $(M,g)$  at
$\rc' <\rc$.   A natural coarse graining would be via a random selection of elements in $C$ such that for every $n$ elements
of $C$ roughly $n'=(\rc'/\rc) n$ elements are chosen. Even if $C$ itself does not faithfully embed into $(M,g)$ at $\rc$, it is
possible that a coarse graining of $C$ can be   embedded. This would be in keeping with our sense in CST that the deep
quantum regime need not be manifold-like.   One
can also envisage manifold-like causal sets with   a regular  fixed lattice-like structure  attached to each element similar to a 
``fibration'',  in the spirit of Kaluza--Klein theories. Instead of the coarse graining procedure, it would be more
appropriate to  take the  quotient with respect to this fibre to obtain the continuum like causal
set. Recently, the implications of coarse graining in CST, both
dynamically  and
kinematically, were considered in \cite{astridcg}  based on renormalisation techniques. 

\subsection{Discreteness without Lorentz breaking} 


It is often assumed that a fundamental discreteness is incompatible with continuous symmetries.  As was pointed
out  in \cite{tdlee},  in the Euclidean context, symmetry can be preserved on average in a random lattice.
In \cite{bomhensor}, it was shown that a causal set in $\cC(\mink^d,\rc)$ not only preserves Lorentz invariance on
average, but in \emph{every} realisation, with respect to the Poisson distribution.  Thus,  in a very specific sense a manifold-like   causal set does not break Lorentz invariance.  In
order to see the contrast between the Lorentzian and Euclidean cases we present the arguments of \cite{bomhensor}
starting with the easier  Euclidean case.

Consider the Euclidean plane $\cP = (\re^2,\delta_{ab})$, and let   $\Phi: \cC(\cP,\rc) \hookrightarrow \cP$ be the
natural  embedding map, where $\cC(\cP,\rc)$ denotes the ensemble of Poisson sprinklings into $\cP$ at density $\rc$. A rotation $r \in SO(2)$ about a point $p \in \cP$, induces a map
$r^* : \cC(\cP,\rc) \rightarrow \cC(\cP,\rc)$, where $r^*=\Phi^{-1}\circ r \circ \Phi$ and similarly a 
translation $t$ in $\cP$ induces the map $t^*: \cC(\cP,\rc)
\rightarrow \cC(\cP,\rc)$. The action of the  Euclidean group  is clearly not transitive on $\cC(\cP,\rc)$ but has non-trivial orbits which provide a fibration of $\cC(\cP,\rc)$. Thus 
the ensemble $\cC(\cP,\rc)$ preserves the Euclidean group on average. This is
the sense in which the discussion of \cite{tdlee} states that the random discretisation preserves the Euclidean group.

The situation is however different for a \emph{given} realisation $ P \in \cC(\cP,\rc)$. Fixing an 
element $e \in \Phi(P)$,
we  define a {direction} $\vd \in S^1$, the space of unit vectors in
$\cP$ centred at $e$.  Under  a rotation $r$ about $e$, $\vd \rightarrow r^*(\vd)\in S^1$.  In general, we want a rule that assigns a
natural direction to every $P \in \cC(\cP,\rc)$. One simple choice is to find the 
closest element to $e$  in $\Phi(P)$, which \emph{is}  well defined in this    Euclidean context.  Moreover, this element is almost surely unique, since the probability of  two elements being at the same radius from $e$ is zero in a Poisson distribution.
Thus we can  define  a  ``direction map''  $\vD_e: \cC(\cP,\rc) \rightarrow S^1$ for a fixed $e \in \Phi(P)$ consistent with the rotation map, i.e.,  $\vD_e$ commutes with any $r\in SO(2)$, or is \emph{equivariant}. 

Associated with  $\cC(\cP,\rc)$, is a probability distribution $\mu$ arising  from the Poisson sprinkling  which associates with
every measurable set $\alpha$ in $\cC(\cP,\rc)$ a probability $\mu(\alpha) \in [0,1]$. The Poisson distribution being
volume preserving  
\citep{stoyan},  the measure on $\cC(\cP,\rc)$  moreover must be independent of the action of the  Euclidean group on $\cC(\cP,\rc)$, i.e.:  $\mu \circ r =\mu$. 


In analogy with a continuous map, a measurable map is one whose 
preimage from  a measurable set is itself a measurable set. The natural map $\vD$ we have defined is a measurable map, and we can use it to define a measure on $S^1$: $\mu_\vD \equiv \mu \circ
\vD^{-1}$.   
Using the invariance of $\mu$ under rotations  and the equivariance of $\vD$ under rotations 
\begin{equation} 
\mu_\vD=\mu\circ r \circ \vD^{-1} = \mu \circ \vD^{-1} \circ r
=\mu_\vD \circ r \, \, \, \forall \, \, r \in SO(2),  
\end{equation} 
we see that $\mu_\vD$ is also invariant under rotations. Because 
$S^1$ is compact, this does not lead to a contradiction. In analogy with the construction used in \cite{bomhensor} for the Lorentzian case, we choose a  measurable set  $s\equiv (0,2\pi/n) \in S^1$. A  
rotation by  $r(2\pi/n)$, takes $s \rightarrow s'$ which is non-overlapping, so that after  $n$ successive rotations,
$r^n(2\pi/n)\circ s = s$. Since  each rotation does not change
$\mu_\vD$ and  $\mu_\vD(S^1)=1$, this means that $\mu_\vD(s)=1/n$.   
Thus,  it \emph{is} possible to assign a consistent direction for a given realisation $P\in \cC(\cP,\rc)$ and hence break
Euclidean symmetry. 

However, this is not the case for the space of  sprinklings $\cC({\mink^d},\rc)$ into $\mink^d$, where the hyperboloid  $\cH^{d-1}$ now
denotes  the space of future directed unit vectors and is invariant under the Lorentz group $SO(n-1,1)$ about a fixed
point $p\in \mink^{d-1}$.  To begin with, there is no  ``natural'' direction map. Let $C \in \cC(\mink^d,\rc)$.  To find an element  which is
closest to some fixed $e \in \Phi(C)$, one has to take the infimum over $J^+(e)$ , or some suitable Lorentz invariant
subset of it, which being non-compact, does not exist.  Assume that \emph{some} measurable direction map $D: \Omega_{\mink^d} \rightarrow \cH^{d-1}$,  does exist.  Then the above arguments imply  that $\mu_D$ must be invariant under Lorentz boosts. The
action of successive Lorentz transformations $\Lambda$ can take a given
measurable set $h \in \cH^{d-1}$ to an infinite number of copies that are
non-overlapping, and \emph{of the same measure}. Since $\cH^{d-1}$ is non-compact,  this is not  possible  unless each set is of measure zero, but since this is true for any measurable set $h$ and we require $\mu_D(\cH^{d-1})=1$, this is a contradiction.  This proves the following theorem \citep{bomhensor}:   

\begin{theorem} In dimensions $n>1$ there exists no equivariant
measurable map $\vD: \cC(\mink^d,\rc) \rightarrow \cH$, i.e., 
\begin{equation} 
\vD \circ \Lambda = \Lambda \circ \vD \, \, \forall \, \Lambda \in
SO(n-1,1).  
\end{equation}   
\end{theorem}

\begin{figure}[ht]

  $ is $\cH^{d-1}$.}
\label{Directions.fig}
\end{figure}

In other words, even for a given sprinkling $\omega \in \Omega_{\mink^d}$ it is not possible to consistently pick a
direction  in $\cH^{d-1}$. Consistency means that under a boost $\Lambda: \omega \rightarrow \Lambda\circ w$, and
hence $D(\omega) \rightarrow \Lambda \circ D(\omega) \in \cH^{d-1}$. Crucial to this  argument is the use of the Poisson
distribution.\footnote{It is interesting to ask if other choices of uniform distribution satisfy the above theorem. If so, then
our criterion for a uniform distribution could not only include ones that minimise the fluctuations but also those that
respect Lorentz invariance.}  Thus, an important prediction of CST is local Lorentz invariance.  Tests of Lorentz invariance over the last couple of decades have produced an ever-tightening
bound, which is therefore consistent with CST \citep{li}. 




\subsection{Forks in the road: What makes CST so ``different''?} 
\label{ssec:forks}


In many ways CST  doesn't  fit  the  standard paradigms adopted by other approaches to quantum
gravity and it is worthwhile trying to understand the source of this difference.  The program is minimalist but
also 
rigidly constrained by its continuum approximation. The ensuing non-locality  means that the apparatus of local
physics is not readily available to CST. 



\cite{lambdaone}  describes the route to quantum gravity and the various forks at which one has to make choices.
Different routes  may lead to the same destination: for example
(barring interpretational questions),   simple quantum systems  can be
described equally well by the path integral and the canonical approach. However, this
need not be the case in gravity: a set of consistent choices may lead  you down a
unique path, unreachable from another route. Starting from broad principles,  Sorkin argued that  certain
choices at a  fork are preferable to others for a theory quantum gravity. These include the choice of  Lorentzian over Euclidean,
the path integral over canonical quantisation and discreteness over the continuum.   This  set of choices leads to a
CST-like theory, while choosing the Lorentzian-Hamiltonian-continuum route  leads to a canonical approach like Loop
Quantum Gravity.

Starting with CST as the final destination, we can work backward to retrace our steps to see what forks had
to be taken and why other routes are impossible to take. The choice  at the discreteness versus continuum fork and the
Lorentzian versus Euclidean fork are obvious from our earlier discussions. As we  explain below, the other essential fork that \emph{has} to be taken
in CST is the histories approach to quantisation.

One of the standard routes to quantisation is via  the canonical approach.  Starting with the phase space of a
classical system, with or without constraints,  quantisation rules  give rise to the 
familiar apparatus of Hilbert spaces and self adjoint operators.   In quantum gravity,  apart
from interpretational issues, this route has difficult technical hurdles, some of which have been partially
overcome \citep{ashtekar}. Essential to the canonical formulation is the $3+1$ split of a spacetime $M=\Sigma \times \re$,
where $\Sigma$ is a Cauchy hypersurface, on which are defined the canonical phase space variables which capture the intrinsic and
extrinsic geometry of $\Sigma$. 

The continuum approximation of CST however, does not allow a meaningful definition of a Cauchy hypersurface, because of 
the `` graphical non-locality'' inherent in a continuum like  causal set,
as we will now show.  We begin by defining an \emph{antichain} to be a set of unrelated elements in
  $C$, and an \emph{inextendible antichain} to be an antichain $\cA \subset C$ such that every element $e \in C
  \backslash \cA$ is related to an element of $\cA$.  The   natural choice for a   discrete analog  of a
Cauchy  hypersurface is therefore an {inextendible antichain} $\ca$, which separates the \emph{set} $C$ into its future and past, so that we can
express $C=\fut(\ca) \sqcup
\past(\ca) \sqcup \ca$,  with  $\sqcup$ denoting disjoint union. However, an element  in $\past(\ca)$ can be related via
a link to an 
element in $\fut(\ca)$ thus ``bypassing'' $\ca$. An example of a  ``missing link'' is  depicted in Fig
\ref{Missinglinks.fig}.   This means that unlike a Cauchy hypersurface, $\ca$ is not a summary of its
past, and hence a canonical decomposition using Cauchy hypersurfaces is not viable \citep{antichain}.  On the other
hand, each causal
set is a  ``history'',  and since the sample space of causal sets is countable, one can construct a path integral or path-sum as
over causal sets. We will describe the dynamics of causal sets in more detail in Sect.~\ref{sec:dynamics}. 
\begin{figure}[!htb]

\caption{A ``missing link'' from $e$ to $e'$ which ``bypasses'' the inextendible antichain $\ca$.}
\label{Missinglinks.fig}
\end{figure}

Before moving on, we comment on the condition of local finiteness which, as we have pointed out,   provides an intrinsic
  definition of spacetime discreteness. This does not need a continuum approximation. An alternative definition would be
  for the causal set to be  countable, which along with the continuum approximation is sufficient to ensure the number
  to volume correspondence. This includes causal sets with  order intervals of infinite cardinality. This
  allows us to extend  causal set discretisation to more general spacetimes, like anti de Sitter spacetimes, where there
exist  events $p,q$ in the spacetime for which  $\vol(\Alex[p,q])$ is not finite. However, what is ultimately of
interest is the dynamics and in particular, the sample space $\Omega$ of causal sets. In the growth models we will encounter in 
Sect.~\ref{ssec:csg},\ref{ssec:beable} and \ref{ssec:qsg} the sample space consists of past finite posets, while in the
continuum-inspired dynamics of Sect.~\ref{ssec:partn} it consists of finite element posets. Thus, while countable posets may be relevant to a broader
framework in which to study the  dynamics of causal sets, it suffices for the present to focus on locally finite
posets.
