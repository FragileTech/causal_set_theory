\section{Kinematics or geometric reconstruction}
\label{sec:kinematics} 

In this section we discuss the program of geometric reconstruction in which topological and geometric
invariants of a continuum spacetime $(M,g)$ are ``reconstructed'' from the  underlying ensemble of causal sets. The assumption that such a reconstruction
exists for any covariant observable in $(M,g)$ comes from the Hauptvermutung of CST discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:cst}.


In the statement of the Hauptvermutung,  we used the phrase ``approximately
isometric'', with the promise of an explanation in this section.  A rigorous definition  requires the
notion of  closeness of two Lorentzian spacetimes. In Riemannian geometry, one has the Gromov--Hausdorff distance \citep{petersen}, but there is no simple extension to
Lorentzian geometry, in part because of the indefinite signature. In  \cite{bommeyer}  a measure of closeness of two Lorentzian manifolds was  given in terms of a pseudo distance
function, which however is neither symmetric nor satisfies the triangle inequality. 
Subsequently, in a series of papers,  a true distance function was defined on the space of Lorentzian
geometries, dubbed the Lorentzian Gromov--Hausdorff distance \citep{bomclose,noldusone,noldustwo,bomnoldus,bomnoldustwo}.  While this makes
the statement of the Hauptvermutung precise, there is as yet no complete proof. Recently, 
a purely order theoretic criterion has been used to determine the closeness of causal sets and  prove a version  of the
Hauptvermutung ({\it Sorkin and Zwane, work in progress}).   


Apart from these more formal constructions, as we will describe below, a large body of evidence has accumulated in
favour of the Hauptvermutung.  In the program of geometric reconstruction, we look for order invariants in continuum
like causal sets which correspond to manifold (either topological or geometric) invariants of the spacetime.  These
\emph{manifold invariants} include dimension, spatial topology, distance functions between fixed elements in the spacetime,
scalar curvature, the discrete Einstein--Hilbert action, the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, Green functions for
scalar fields, and the d'Alembertian operator for scalar fields. The identification of the order invariant $\cO$ with
the manifold invariant $\cG$ then ensures that a causal set $C$ that faithfully embeds into $(M,g)$ cannot faithfully
embed into a spacetime with a different manifold invariant $\cG'$.\footnote{This is in the sense of an ensemble,
  since the faithful embedding is defined statistically.}  Thus, in this sense two manifolds can be defined to be  close with respect to
their specific manifold invariants. We can then state the  limited,  order-invariant version of the Hauptvermutung: 

% for each manifold invariant $\cO$:
\textit{\textbf{$\cO$-Hauptvermutung:}  If $C$ faithfully
  embeds into $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ then $(M,g)$ and $(M',g')$ have the same manifold invariant $\cG$ associated with 
  $\cO$.}

The longer our list of correspondences between order invariants and manifold invariants, the closer we are
to proving the full Hauptvermutung.


In order to correlate a manifold invariant $\cG$ with an order invariant  $\cO$, we must   recast geometry in purely
order theoretic terms.  Note that since locally finite posets appear in a wide range of
contexts,  the poset literature contains several order invariants, but these are typically not related to  the manifold
invariants of interest to us.  The challenge is to choose the appropriate invariants that  correspond to manifold  invariants. Guessing and verifying this using
both analytic and numerical tools is the art of geometric
reconstruction. 

A \emph{labelling} of a causal set $C$ is an injective map: $C \rightarrow \mathbb N$, which is the 
analogue of a choice of coordinate system in the continuum.  By an \emph{order invariant} in a finite causal set $C$ we mean a function $\cO: C \rightarrow \re$ such that $\cO$ is
independent of the {labelling} of $C$. For a manifold-like causal set\footnote{We remind the reader
  that the ensemble depends on the spacetime $(M,g)$ but we suppress the dependence on $g$ for the sake of brevity.} $C \in \cC(M,\rc)$, associated to every order
invariant $\cO$ is the random variable $\bO$ whose expectation value $\av{\bO} $ in the ensemble $\cC(M,\rc)$ is either equal to or limits (in
the large $\rc$ limit) to a manifold invariant $\cG$ of $(M,g)$.  We will typically  restrict to compact regions of $(M,g)$ in order to deal
with finite values of $\bO$.

The first candidates for geometric order invariants were defined for $\cC(\Alex[p,q],\rc)$ where  $\Alex[p,q]$
is an  Alexandrov interval in $\mink^d$. Some of these have 
been later generalised to Alexandrov intervals (or causal diamonds)  in \emph{Riemann Normal Neighbourhoods (RNN)} in
curved spacetime. These manifold invariants are in this sense ``local''. 
In order to find \emph{spatial}  global invariants, the relevant spacetime region is  
a \emph{Gaussian Normal Neighbourhood (GNN)} of a compact Cauchy hypersurface in a globally hyperbolic spacetime. As
discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:cst}  compactness is
necessary for manifold-likeness since otherwise  there is a finite probability for there to be  arbitrarily large voids which negates the
discrete-continuum correspondence.   

%Causal set non-locality, from which local geometric invariants must be computed.  

Before proceeding, we remind the reader that we are restricting ourselves to  manifold-like causal sets in this section
only because of the focus on  CST kinematics and the continuum approximation. All the order invariants, however, can be calculated
for \emph{any}  causal set, manifold-like  or not. These order invariants give us an important class of covariant
observables,  essential to constructing a 
quantum theory of causal sets. As we will see in Sect.~\ref{sec:dynamics} they play an important role in the
quantum dynamics. 

The analytic results in this section are typically found in the continuum limit,  $\rc \rightarrow \infty$.  Strictly
speaking, this limit is unphysical in CST because of the assumption of a fundamental discreteness. There are 
fluctuations at  finite $\rc $ which give important deviations from the continuum with potential phenomenological consequences. These are 
however  not always easy to calculate analytically and hence require simulations 
to assess  the size of fluctuations at finite $\rc$. As we will see below, CST kinematics therefore needs a combination
of analytical and numerical tools. 


\subsection{Spacetime dimension estimators} 
\label{ssec:dimn} 

The earliest result in CST is a dimension estimator for Minkowski spacetime due to \cite{myrheim}\footnote{This remarkable preprint also
  contains the first expression, again without  detailed proof, of the volume of a small causal diamond in an arbitrary
  spacetime.} and predates BLMS \citep{blms}.  A closely related dimension estimator 
was given by \cite{meyer}, which is now collectively known as the \emph{Myrheim--Meyer}
dimension estimator.  

The {number of relations}  $R$ in a finite $n$ element causal set $C$ is the number
of ordered 
pairs $e_i, e_j \in C$ such that $e_i \prec e_j$.  Since the maximum number of possible  relations on $n$ elements  is
$\binom{n}{2}$,  the  {ordering fraction} is defined as 
\begin{equation} 
r =\frac{2R}{n(n-1)}. 
\end{equation}
It was shown by \cite{myrheim}  that $r$ is dependent only on the dimension
when $C$ faithfully embeds into $\mink^d$.    

We now describe the construction of a closely related dimension estimator by \cite{meyer}. Consider an Alexandrov interval $\Alex_d[p,q] \subset \mink^d$ of volume $V>> \rc^{-1}$.   
We are interested in calculating the expectation value of the random variable $\bR$ associated with $R$ for the ensemble
$\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$.  This is the probability that a pair of elements $e_1,e_2 \in \Alex_d[p,q]$ are related.    Given $e_1$, the
probability of  there being an $e_2$ in its future is given by the volume of the region $J^+(e_1) \cap J^-(p)$
%\mnote{Definitions of  $I^\pm,J^\pm$}
in units of the discreteness scale, while the probability to pick $e_1$  is
given by the volume of $\Alex_d[p,q]$. This joint probability can be calculated as follows. 


Without loss of generality, choose  $p=(-T/2,0,\ldots, 0)$ and
$q=(T/2, 0, \ldots, 0)$, so that the total volume
\begin{equation}
  V = \zeta_d T^d,  \quad  \zeta_d \equiv \frac{\vs_{d-2}}{2^{d-1} d(d-1)}
  \label{eq:zetad} 
\end{equation} 
 with  $\vs_{d-2}$  the volume of the unit ${d-2}$ sphere. 
For this choice,  
 \begin{equation} 
   \av{\bR} = \rc^2 \int\limits_{\Alex_d}\,\,\,  dx_1 \negs \negs\int\limits_{J^+(x_1) \cap J^-(q)}\negs\negs dx_2  =\,
   \rc^2 \, \,  \zeta_d \,  \int\limits_{\Alex_d}\,\,dx_1 T_1^d \,,
\end{equation} 
where $T_1$ is the proper time from $x_1$ to $q$, and $\Alex_d \equiv\Alex_d[p,q]$. Evaluating the integral, one finds 
\begin{equation} 
\label{ctwoflat} 
 \av{\bR} = \rc^2 V^2 \frac{\Gamma(d+1) \Gamma(\frac{d}{2})}{4 \Gamma(\frac{3d}{2})}. 
\end{equation}
Using $\av{\bbn} = \rc V$,  \cite{meyer} obtained a dimension estimator from $\av{\bR}$ by noting that the ratio
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:dimension} 
\frac{\av{\bR}}{\av{\bbn}^2} = \frac{\Gamma(d+1) \Gamma(\frac{d}{2})}{4 \Gamma(\frac{3d}{2})} \equiv \ff(d) 
\end{equation} 
is a function only of $d$. In  the large $n$ limit 
this is is half of Myrheim's ordering fraction $r$. 


However, the fluctuations in $\av{\bR}$ are
large and hence the right dimension cannot be obtained from  a single realisation $C \in \cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$, but rather
by  averaging over the ensemble.  
For large enough $\rc$, however, the relative
fluctuations should become smaller, and allow one to distinguish causal sets obtained from sprinkling into different
dimensional Alexandrov intervals. Such systematic tests have been carried out numerically using sprinklings into
different spacetimes by \cite{reid} and show a general convergence as $\rc$ is taken to be large, or
equivalently the interval size is taken to be large. 


 How can we use this dimension estimator in practice?  Let $C$ be a causal set of sufficiently large cardinality
 $n$. If the dimension obtained from Eq.~(\ref{eq:dimension})  is approximately  an integer $d$, this means that $C$ cannot be distinguished
 from a causal set that  belongs to $\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$ using {just} the dimension estimator, for $n \sim \rc \vol(\Alex_d)$. We denote this by   $C \sim_d
\Alex_d$. This also means that $C$ cannot be a typical member of $\cC(\Alex_{d'},1)$ for dimension $d'\neq
d$, so that $C \not\sim_{d'} \Alex_{d'}$. The equivalence $C\sim_d \Alex_d$ itself does not of course imply that   $C \sim \Alex_d$ or  even  that $C$ is manifold-like. Rather, it is the limited
statement that its dimension estimator is the same as that of a typical causal set in $ \cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$ for  $n \sim
\rc \vol(\Alex_d)$.

This is our first example of a $\cO$-Hauptvermutung, where the order invariant $\cO$ is
the  ordering fraction $r$ and the spacetime  dimension $d$  is the corresponding manifold invariant $\cG$. This example
provides a useful  template in the search for manifold-like order
  invariants some of which we will describe in the next few subsections. 



Using simulations \cite{carlipdrone} recently obtained the Myrheim--Meyer
dimension  as function of interval size for nested intervals in a causal set in $\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$ for
$d=3,4,5$. As the interval size decreases, they found that the resulting causal sets are likely to
be disconnected due to the large fluctuations at  small volumes. In the extreme case, there
is a single point with
no relations and hence the Myrheim--Meyer dimension goes to $\infty$ rather than $0$. Using a criterion to discard such
disconnected regions, it was shown that this dimension estimator gives a value of $2$ at small volumes, 
even when $d=3,4,5$, in support of the dimensional reduction conjecture in quantum gravity \citep{carlipdr} which we 
discuss briefly in Sect.~\ref{sec:matter}. 

Meyer's construction is in fact
more general and yields a whole family of dimension estimators.  If we think of the relation  $e_1\prec e_2$ as a \emph{chain} $c_2$ of two elements, then a \emph{$k$-chain} $c_k$ is the causal sequence $e_1 \prec e_2 \ldots \prec e_{k-1} \prec
e_k$ (see Fig.~\ref{chain.fig}), where the \emph{length} of $c_k$ is defined as $k-2$.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering \resizebox{3in}{!}  {\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{chains}}
\caption{Two different chains between $x$ and $x'$. One is a $k=4$ chain and the other is a $k=7$ chain.}
\label{chain.fig}
\end{figure}
We denote the \emph{abundance}, or number  of the $c_k$'s contained  in $C$, by $C_k$. Its expectation value in
$\cC(\Alex_d[p,q],\rc)$ is therefore  given by a sequence of $k$ nested integrals over a sequence of nested Alexandrov
intervals,  $\Alex_d[p,q] \supset  I(x_1,q) \supset I(x_2,q) \ldots I(x_k, q) $ which, as was shown by \cite{meyer},  can be
calculated inductively to give 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ckflat}  
\av{\bCk} =\rc^k\chi_k V^k, \qquad 
\chi_k\equiv \frac{1}{k} \biggl(\frac{\Gamma(d+1)}{2}\biggr)^{k-1}
\frac{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2})\Gamma(d)}{\Gamma(\frac{kd}{2})\Gamma(\frac{(k+1)d}{2})}.
\end{equation} 
Thus for any $k,k'$, the ratio of $\av{\bC_k}^{1/k}$ to ${\av{\bC_{k'}}^{1/k'}}$ only depends on the dimension. This
gives a multitude of dimension estimators. 


Meyer's calculation of $\av{\bC_k}$ was   generalised to a small causal diamond $\Alex_d[p,q]$ that lies in an  RNN of a general 
spacetime, i.e., one for which $RT^2 << 1$, where  $T$ is the proper time from $p$ to $q$ and $R$ denotes components of
the curvature  at the centre of the
diamond  \citep{rss}. In such a region the dimension  satisfies the more complicated equation 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\ff^2(d) \biggl( -\frac{1}{3} \frac{(d+2)}{(3d+2)} -
\frac{(4d+2)}{(2d+2)}\biggl(\frac{\av{\bC_3}}{\chi_3}\biggr) ^{\frac{4}{3}} \frac{1}{\av{\bC_1}^4}  &&  \nn \\ 
+ \frac{1}{3} \frac{(4d+2)(5d+2)}{(2d+2)(3d+2)} \frac{\av{\bC_4}}{\chi_4} \frac{1}{\av{\bC_1}^4} \biggr)
&=&- \frac{\av{\bC_2}^2}{\av{\bC_1}^4} \,,
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\ff(d)$ is given by Eq.~(\ref{eq:dimension}). It is straightforward to show that the expression above reduces to the Myrheim--Meyer dimension
estimator in $\mink^d$.  The calculation of \cite{rss} uses a  result of \cite{ks}, which makes explicit
earlier calculations of the volume of a causal diamond in an RNN \citep{myrheim,gs}. 
The $C_k$ themselves
are order invariants and hence are covariant observables for finite element causal sets.


This class of dimension estimators is just one among several that have appeared in the literature, including the {mid-point scaling estimator} \citep{bomthesis,reid}, and more
recent ones \citep{intervals,bomemad}. We refer the reader to the literature for more details. 

\subsection{Topological invariants}
\label{ssec:topology} 
 
The next step in our reconstruction is that of topology.  There are several poset topologies described in the
literature (see \citealt{stanley} as well as  \citealt{suryatop} for a review). However, our interest is in finding one that most closely resembles the ``coarse'' continuum topology. It is clear that the full manifold topology cannot be reproduced in a causal set since it
requires arbitrarily small open sets. However, according to the Hauptvermutung,  topological invariants like the homology groups and the fundamental
groups of $(M,g)$ should be encoded in the causal set. 

 A natural  choice for a topology in $C$ based on the order relation  is one generated by the order
intervals  $\cAlex[e_i,e_j] \equiv \fut(e_i) \cap \past(e_j)$. Indeed, in the continuum the topology generated by their
analogs, the Alexandrov intervals,  can be shown to be  equivalent to the manifold topology  in strongly causal
spacetimes \citep{penrose}.   However, even for a causal set approximated by
 a finite region of $\mink^d$,  this order-interval topology is roughly discrete or
 trivial.  This is because the intersection of any two intervals in the continuum can be  of order the discreteness scale
and hence  contain  just  a  single element of the causal set, thus trivialising the topology.  
A way forward is to use the causal structure to obtain a locally finite open covering of $C$ and construct the
  associated  ``nerve simplicial complex'' (see \citealt{munkres}). 

In \cite{homology,stablehomology},  a ``spatial'' homology of $C$ was obtained in this manner by considering an inextendible 
 antichain $\cA \subset C$ (see Sect.~\ref{ssec:forks}),    which is an (imperfect) analog of a Cauchy hypersurface.
 The natural topology on $\cA$ is the discrete topology since
there are no causal relations amongst the elements. In order to
provide a topology on $\cA$, one needs to ``borrow'' information from a neighbourhood of
$\cA$. The method devised was to consider
elements to the future of $\cA$ and ``thicken'' by a parameter $v$  to some collar
neighbourhood  $\cT_v(\cA) \equiv\{e | \, |\ifut(\cA)\cap \ipast(e)| \leq v \}$. Here $\ifut$ and $\ipast$ denote the \emph{inclusive future and
  past} respectively, where for any $S \subset C$, $\ifut(S)=\fut(S) \cup S$ and  $\ipast(S)=\past(S) \cup S$.



A topology can then be induced on $\cA$ from $\cT_v(\cA)$ by considering the open cover $\{\cO_v \equiv\past(e) \cap
\cA\}$ of $\cA$, for  $e \in {\cM}_v(\cA)$, the  set of future most elements of  $\cT_v(\cA)$.  The 
``nerve''  simplicial complex $\cN_v(\cA)$ can be constructed 
from $\{\cO_v\}$ for  every $v$.   For a spacetime $(M,g)$  with compact Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$, and for  $C \in \cC(M,\rc)$ 
it was shown in \cite{homology,stablehomology}  that there exists a range of
values of  $v$ such that  $\cN_v(\cA)$ is  homological to $\Sigma$ (up to the discreteness scale)  as long as there is a sufficient
separation  between the discreteness  scale $\ell_c\equiv V_c^{{1}/{d}}$ and $\ell_K$ the scale of extrinsic curvature of
$\Sigma$.  

One might also imagine a similar construction on $C$ using  the nerve simplicial complex  of 
  causal intervals of a given minimal cardinality  $v$ which cover $C$. However, in the continuum the intersection of such intervals may not
  only  be of order the discreteness scale, but also such that they ``straddle'' each other. As an example consider the
  equal volume intervals  $\Alex[p_1,q_1], \Alex[p_2,q_2]$ in $\mink^2$  where $p_1,q_1$ are at $x=0$ in a  frame
  $(x,t)$, with the $x$-coordinate of
$p_2$ being  $<0$ and that of $q_2$ being $>0$.  These two intervals not only intersect, but  straddle each other, i.e.,
the set difference 
$\Alex[p_1,q_1] \backslash \Alex[p_2,q_2]$ is disconnected as is  $\Alex[p_2,q_2]\backslash \Alex[p_1,q_1]$. By choosing $p_2,q_2$
appropriately, the intersection  region can be made very ``thin'', pushing most of the volume of $\Alex[p_2,q_2]$ out of
$\Alex[p_1,q_1]$. Thus, while they intersect in $\mink^2$ these intervals  would not intersect in the corresponding causal set
$C$. This results in a non-trivial cycle in the associated nerve simplicial complex for $C$, which is absent  in the
continuum. Such a  construction can be therefore made to work only in a sufficiently localised region within $C$.

An example of  a localised of subset of $C$ is the region   sandwiched between two inextendible and
non-overlapping antichains $\cA_1$ and $\cA_2$. The resulting homology constructed from the nerve
simplicial complex {of the order intervals of volume $\sim v$} is then is associated with 
a spacetime region rather than just space, and hence includes topology change. While preliminary investigations
  along these lines have been started, there is much that remains to be understood.  Another possibility for
characterising the spatial homology uses  chain complexes but this has only been partially
investigated.  A further open direction is to obtain  the causal set analogues of {other} topological invariants. 


\subsection{Geodesic distance: timelike, spacelike and spatial} 
\label{ssec:distance}

In Minkowski spacetime, the proper time between two events is the 
\emph{longest} path between them; the shortest 
path between two time-like separated events  is of course any  zig-zag null path, which has zero length. In a causal set
$C$, if  $e_i \prec e_f$, one can construct different  chains from $e_i$ to $e_f$, of varying lengths. A  natural choice
for the discrete timelike geodesic
distance between $e_i$ and $e_f$ is  the length of the longest chain, which we denote by  $l(e_i,e_j)$, as was suggested
by \cite{myrheim}.  
It was shown  in  \cite{bg} that the expectation value of the associated random variable $\bl$  in the ensemble $\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$  limits to a dimension dependent constant 
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rho_c \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\av{\mathbf{l}(x,x')}} {(\rc  V(x,x'))^{1/d}} =   m_d  
\end{equation} 
where 
\begin{equation} 
1.77\leq\frac{2^{1-\frac{1}{d}}}{\Gamma(1+\frac{1}{d})}\leq
m_d\leq \frac{2^{1-\frac{1}{d}}e\,(\Gamma(1+d))^{\frac{1}{d}}}{d}\leq
         2.62 
\end{equation} 
For a finite  $\rc$, the fluctuations in $l(e_i,e_j)$ are  very  large \citep{meyer,bachmat} and hence the correspondence
becomes meaningful only when averaged over a large ensemble. 

In \cite{rss}, an expression for the proper time $T$ of 
a small causal diamond $\Alex_d$ in an RNN of a  $d$ dimensional spacetime was obtained to leading order correction in terms of the random
variables $\bC_k$ associated to the abundance of $k$-chains,    
\begin{equation} 
\label{T}
T^{3d}=\frac{1}{2d^2 \rc^3}\biggl(J_1-2J_2+J_3 \biggr).   
\end{equation} 
where 
\begin{equation} 
\label{moreidentities}
J_k \equiv  (kd +2)  ((k+1)d+2) \frac{1}{\zeta_d^3}\biggl(\frac{\av{\bC_k}}{\chi_k }\biggr)^{3/k},  
\end{equation}
with $\av{\bC_k}$  the ensemble average in  $\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$ and $\zeta_d, \chi_k$ defined in Eqs.~(\ref{eq:zetad}) and
(\ref{eq:ckflat}). This definition is not intrinsic to a single causal set
but requires the full ensemble. Nevertheless, it is of interest to study the intrinsic version of the expression by
replacing  $\av{\bC_k}$ by   $C_k$ for each causal set and then taking the  ensemble average to check for
convergence.   Recent simulations suggest that these expressions converge fairly rapidly to their continuum values. 

Spacelike distance is far less straightforward to compute from the
poset, because events that are spacelike to each other have no natural
relationship to each other. We saw this already in trying to find a topology on the inextendible
antichain. Thus, the relationship must be ``borrowed'' from the
elements in the causal past and future of the spacelike events.  \cite{bg} defined the following,  naive spatial distance function in
$\mink^d$. For a given spacelike pair $p,q \in \mink^d$, the 
{common future and past} are defined as 
$ J^+(p,q)\equiv J^+(p) \cap J^+(q)$ and  $ J^-(p,q)\equiv J^-(p) \cap J^-(q)$ respectively. For  every $r \in  J^+(p,q) $ and
$ s  \in J^-(p,q) $ let $\tau(s,r)$ be the timelike distance. Then the  naive distance function is given by 
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:sdist} 
\dns(p,q) \equiv min_ {r,s} \tau(r,s). 
\end{equation} 
While this is a perfectly good continuum definition of the distance in $\mink^d$, it fails for the causal set when $d>2$
since the number of pairs $(r,s)$ which minimise $\tau(r,s)$ lies  in the region between a co-dimension $2$ hyperboloid
and the light cone $\tau=0$.  In the causal set we
can use the length of the maximal chain $\bl(r,s)$ to obtain $\tau(r,s)$, but in $d>2$ since there are an infinite
number of proper time minimising pairs $(r,s)$, there will almost surely be those for which $\bl(r,s)$ is drastically
underestimated. The minimisation in Eq.~(\ref{eq:sdist}) will then always give $2$ as the spatial distance!

\cite{rw}  generalised  the naive distance function using minimising pairs $(r,s)$ such that either $r$ or $s$ is
linked to both $p$ and $q$.  Instead of minimising over these pairs (again infinite), the \emph{2-link} distance can be 
calculated by averaging over the pairs. Numerical simulations for the naive distance and the 2-link distance for sprinklings
into a finite region of $\mink^3$ show that the latter stabilises as a function of $\rc$. The former underestimates the
spatial distance compared to the continuum, and the latter overestimates it. The spatial distance functions of both \cite{bg}
and \cite{rw} are however strictly
``predistance'' functions since they do not satisfy the triangle inequality.  


Recently a one-parameter family of discrete  induced spatial distance functions was proposed for an inextendible antichain
in a causal set by \cite{esv}.   To begin with, a  one parameter family of continuum  induced distance functions
$d_\epsilon$ was constructed for a globally hyperbolic region $(M,g) $  of spacetime with Cauchy hypersurface
$\Sigma$ using  only the causal structure and the volume element. In  $\mink^d$ with $\Sigma$ a constant time slice in
an inertial reference frame, 
the volume of a past causal cone from $p \succ \Sigma$ has a simple relation to the diameter $D$ of the base of the
cone $J^-(p)\cap \Sigma$
\begin{equation}
  \label{zetadef} 
\vol(J^-(p)\cap J^+(\Sigma))=\zeta_d \biggl(\frac{D}{2}\biggr)^d. 
\end{equation}
Since $D$ is the distance between any two antipodal points on the $S^{d-2}\subset \Sigma$,  this simple
formula defines the induced distance on $\Sigma$. In a general spacetime this
formula can be used to extract an approximate induced distance function in a sufficiently
small region of $\Sigma$.  In order to define the distance function on all of $\Sigma$, a meso-scale $\epsilon$
must be introduced, and the full distance function  can then be obtained by minimising over all segmented paths, such that each
segment is bounded from above by $\epsilon$.   For  $\epsilon
<<  \ell_K$, the scale of the extrinsic curvature of $\Sigma$,   $d_\epsilon$  was shown in \cite{esv} to converge to 
the induced spatial distance function $d_h$ on  $(\Sigma,h)$.

Since the $d_\epsilon$ are constructed from the causal
structure and volume element they are readily defined on  an inextendible antichain on a causal set.  For causal sets
in $\cC(M,\rc)$ with $\Sigma \subset M$ the discrete distance function $d_\epsilon$ was shown to significantly overestimate the
continuum induced distance on $\Sigma$ when the latter is close to the  
discreteness scale $(V_c)^{{1}/{d}}$. This  discrete \emph{``asymptotic silence''} of \cite{ems} mimics the narrowing of
light cones in the UV, and can be traced to the large fluctuations expected around the discreteness scale.  At larger
distances, on the other hand,  $d_\epsilon$ is a good approximation of the continuum induced
distance when $(V_c)^{{1}/{d}}<< \epsilon << \ell_K$.  It was
shown moreover that the  continuum induced distance is slightly underestimated for positive curvature and slightly overestimated  for negative curvature, when restricted
to small regions of $\Sigma$. This was confirmed by extensive  numerical
simulations in $\mink^d$ for $d=2,3$ (see Fig.~\ref{distance.fig}).  This works paves the way to
recovering more spatial geometric invariants from the causal set, and is currently in progress (Eichhorn, Surya and Versteegen).

    scales, the discrete distance gives a good approximation to the continuum induced distance.}

\subsection{The d'Alembertian  for a scalar field } 
\label{ssec:dalem}

One of the very first questions that comes to mind in the continuum approximation of CST is whether a tangent space  can
be defined naturally on a causal set. To answer this (unfortunately in the negative), we need to examine  the non-local nature of a
manifold-like causal set in more detail. 
The nearest neighbours of an element $e$ are
those that it is linked to, both in its future and its past. In a causal set approximated by Minkowski spacetime for
example, and  as discussed in Sect.~\ref{sec:cst}, every element has an infinite number of nearest neighbours (see Fig.~\ref{valency.fig}).  Similarly, the 
``next nearest'' neighbours  to $e$ are those for which the interval $|\cAlex[e,e']| =1$ or $| \cAlex[e',e]|=1$.\footnote{Note that this is the \emph{exclusive} interval and hence there exists exactly
  one element $e''$ such that $e\prec e'' \prec e'$.} 
Thus, in keeping with the covariance of the causal set, we say
that if $e\prec e' $ and $|\cAlex[e,e']|=k$ (or $e'\prec e$ and $|\cAlex[e',e]|=k$),  then    
$e'$ is the $k$-nearest neighbour of
$e$.  Examples of past $k$-nearest
neighbours of an element in a Minkowski-like causal set are shown in Fig.~\ref{nn.fig}.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering \resizebox{3.0in}{!}  {\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Intervals}}
\caption{The layered structure of neighbourhoods. The nearest neighbours are the links or zero intervals, the
    next to nearest neighbours are the 1-element intervals, the etc. Here we depict the types of $0,1,2$ element
    intervals. In the figure two examples of  $3$ element intervals are also shown.}
\label{nn.fig}
\end{figure}


It is already clear from the picture that emerges in $\mink^d$ that,  unlike a regular lattice,  a simple construction of  a locally defined tangent space
from the set of links or next to nearest neighbours to $e$ is not possible, since the valency of
the graph is infinite. This means in particular that derivative
operators cannot also be simply defined. 
How then can we look for the effect of discreteness on  the propagation of fields?  We will discuss this in more detail in Sect.~\ref{sec:matter} but for now we
notice that the best way forward is to look for scalar quantities, rather than more general tensorial ones,  in making the
discrete-continuum correspondence.  

A scalar field d'Alembertian is a good first step. In \cite{sorkinnonlocal,joereviewtwo}, a proposal was given for a discrete
d'Alembertian of a free
scalar field on a causal set approximated by $\mink^2$, and extended in \cite{bd,dionthesis,dg} to higher
dimensions. For a real scalar field on  a causal set $\phi: C \rightarrow \re$ define the  $d=4$ dimensionless
discrete operator
\begin{equation} 
B\phi(e) \equiv \frac{4}{\sqrt{6}}\biggl[-\phi(e)  + \biggl( \sum_{e'\in L_0(e)}  - \, \,  9\!\!\!\!\sum_{e' \in L_1(e)}  + \, \, 16
\!\!\!\!\sum_{e'\in L_2(e)}   - \, \, 8 \!\!\!\!\sum_{e' \in L_3(e)} \biggr) \phi(e')\biggr],
\label{eq:disbk} 
\end{equation} 
where $L_k(e)$ denotes the set of $k$-nearest neighbours to the past  of $e \in C$. This is a highly non-local
operator since it depends on the number of all the (possibly infinite) nearest $k=0,1,2,3$ neighbours. Notice  
the alternating sum whose precise coefficients turn out to be very important to the continuum limit.  The expectation value of the  random variable $\bB\phi(x)$  associated with $\cC(\mink^4,\rc)$ 
at  $x\in \mink^4$ is  
\begin{eqnarray} 
  \!\!\!\!\!\frac{1}{\sqrt{\rc }}\av{\bB\phi(x)}\! &=& \!  \frac{4 \sqrt{\rc}}{\sqrt{6}}\biggl[-\phi(x)  + \nn \\
  && \!\! \rc \!\! \int_{y \in J^-(x)}\!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\! \!\!\!\!\! d^4 y \, \phi(y) \, e^{-\rc
                                         v} \biggl(1-9\rc v + 8 (\rc v)^2 -\frac{4}{3} (\rc v)^3\biggr) \biggr],   
\end{eqnarray} 
where  $v\equiv \vol(\Alex(y,x))$ and we have used the probability $P_n(v) $ for $v$ to contain $n$ elements,
Eq.~(\ref{eq:poisson}). We have also made the expression dimensionful, in order to be able to make a direct comparison with the continuum. 
 Let us consider
the past of $x$ in $\mink^2$ and choose a frame $\cF_\phi$  such that $\phi(y)$ varies slowly in  the immediate past of  $x$
with respect to $\cF_\phi$. 
As   was
shown in $\mink^2$ by \cite{sorkinnonlocal} and in $\mink^4$ by \cite{bd} (see also \citealt{dionthesis}),
for   $\phi$ of  compact
support  there are miraculous cancellations that make the contributions far down the light cone negligible, thus
making the operator effectively local. 

In order to evaluate this integral, we first note that since $\phi$ is of compact support, the region of integration
is compact.  In $\cF_\phi$, a
small $|y-x|$ expansion of  $\phi(y)$ around $\phi(x)$ can be done.  Following \cite{sorkinnonlocal,bd,dionthesis},  the non-compact region
of integration $J^-(x)$ can be  split into 3 non-overlapping regions,
$\cW_1,\cW_2,\cW_3$ in $\cF_\phi$:  $\cW_1$ is  a neighbourhood of $x$,  $\cW_2$ is a neighbourhood of $\partial J^-(x)$ but
bounded away from the origin and $\cW_3$ is bounded away from $\partial J^-(x)$.  The integral over  $\cW_3$ was shown
in \cite{dionthesis} to be bounded from above by an integral that  tends to zero faster than any power of $\rc^{-1}$, while
the integral over $\cW_2$ was shown to go to zero faster than $\rc^{-3/2}$.  The local contribution from $\cW_1$  
dominates so that 
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rc }}\av{\bB\phi(x)} = \Box \phi(x). 
\end{equation}  
Thus, $B(\phi)$ is  ``effectively local'' since its dominant contribution comes from $\cW_1$ which is a local
neighbourhood of $x$ defined by the frame $\cF_\phi$.  In \emph{this}  frame, the contribution to $\bB\phi(x)$ is
dominated by the restrictions of $L_k$ to $\Alex(p,q)\cap J^-(x)$. Thus,   while $\bB\phi(x)$ is not determined just by
the value of $\phi$ at $x$, it depends on $\phi$ only in  an appropriately defined compact neighbourhood of $x$,
rather than all of $J^-(x)$.  This ``restoration of locality'' is an important subtlety in CST kinematics.

How does a scalar field on a causal set evolve under this non-local d'Alembertian?  There are indications that while the
evolution in $d=2$ is stable, it is  unstable in $d=4$ as suggested by \cite{gendalem}. Hence it is  desirable to look for
generalisations  of the $B_\kappa$ operator.  An infinite family of  non-local d'Alembertians has been constructed by 
\cite{gendalem} and shown to give the right continuum limit. It is still an open question whether there is a subfamily of
these operators that lead to a  stable evolution.

An interesting direction that has been explored by \cite{yasamanspectral} is to use the spectral information of the
d'Alembertian operator to obtain all the information about the causal set. This was explored for $\Alex_2[p,q] \subset
\mink^2$ and it  was shown that the spectrum of the d'Alembertian (or Feynman propagator) gives the link matrix (see
Eq.~(\ref{eq:linkm}) below), i.e., the matrix of all linked pairs using which the  entire causal set can be reconstructed
via transitivity. Extending these results to higher dimensions is an interesting open question.   

\subsection{The Ricci scalar and the Benincasa--Dowker action} 
\label{ssec:bdaction}

Next we describe a very important development in CST : the construction of the discrete Einstein--Hilbert action or the
\emph{Benincasa--Dowker (BD) action}  for a causal set \citep{bd,dg}. The approach of \cite{bd} was to generalise
  $\bB\phi(x)$ to an RNN in curved spacetime in $d=2,d=4$. Again, the region of integration can be split into three
  parts as was done for  flat spacetime. The
contribution from $\cW_3$ i.e., away from a neighbourhood of $\partial J^-(x)$ can again be shown to be 
bounded from above by an integral that  tends to zero faster than any power of $\rc^{-1}$.   In the limit, the contribution from the
near region $\cW_1 $ contained in an RNN  is such that 
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rc }}\av{\bB\phi(x)} \lvert_{\cW_1}  = \Box \phi(x) -\frac{1}{2} \cR(x)\phi(x).
\end{equation} 
where $\cR(x)$ is the Ricci scalar \citep{bd,dionthesis}. However, the calculation in region $\cW_2$ which is in the neighbourhood of
$\partial J^-(x)$ but bounded away from the origin,  is non-trivial, and needs a further set of assumptions to show
that it does not contribute in the $\rc \rightarrow \infty$ limit.  A painstaking calculation in \cite{bbd} using Fermi Normal Coordinates shows that
this is indeed the case  in an approximately flat region of a four dimensional spacetime.  Generalising this calculation
to arbitrary spacetimes is
highly non-trivial but is an important open question in CST.   


What is of course exciting about this form for the d'Alembertian Eq.~\ref{eq:disbk} is that it can be used to find the discrete Ricci
curvature and hence the action. Assuming that 
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rc }}\av{\bB\phi(x)}|_{\cW_2}  = 0 
\label{eq:assumptionbd} 
\end{equation} 
holds in all spacetimes, and  putting\footnote{By doing so, we violate the condition that $\phi$ is of
  compact support. However, given that the regions $\cW_3$ and by assumption $\cW_2$  contribute  negligibly, we can
  always ensure this by only requiring constancy of $\phi$ in a neighbourhood of   $\cW_1$.}   $\phi(x)=1$    
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rc }}\av{\bB\phi(x)} = -\frac{1}{2} \cR(x).
\end{equation} 
Thus we can write the dimensionless discrete Ricci curvature at an element $e \in  C$ \citep{dionthesis} as   
\begin{equation} 
R(e) =  \frac{4}{\sqrt{6}}\biggl[ 1 - N_0(e) + 9N_1(e) -16 N_2(e) +8N_3(e)\biggr], 
\end{equation}  
where $N_k(e)\equiv|L_k(e)|$.  Summing over the $n$ elements of a finite element causal set gives the dimensionless discrete action  
\begin{equation} 
\label{BD} 
%\frac{1}{\hbar} S^{(2)} [C]&=& N - 2 N_1 + 4N_2-2N_3 \\  
S^{(4)} (C)= \sum_{e\in C} R(e)=\frac{4}{\sqrt{6}} \biggl[ n-  N_0 + 9N_1-16N_2+8N_3\biggl],      
\end{equation}  
where $N_k$ is the total number of $k$-element order intervals in $C$.  

\cite{bd} (see also \citealt{dionthesis}) showed  that (under the assumption Eq.~(\ref{eq:assumptionbd})) the random
variable $\bS^{(4)}$ associated with $\cC(M,g)$  gives the Einstein--Hilbert action in the continuum limit  
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \hbar \frac{\lc^2}{\lp^2} \av{\bS^{(4)}(C)} = \cS_{EH}(g),   
\label{eq:bdehlimit} 
\end{equation} 
up to (as yet unknown)  boundary  terms.  

Equation~(\ref{eq:bdehlimit})  is exactly true in an approximately flat  region of a four dimensional spacetime  as
shown in  \cite{bbd}.  Proving Eq.~(\ref{eq:assumptionbd})  in general is however non-trivial since there are caustics
in a generic spacetime which complicate the calculation. On the other hand, numerical
simulations suggest that again, up to boundary terms,  the Benincasa--Dowker action $S$ \emph{is} the Einstein--Hilbert
action \citep{dionthesis,willthesis}. We will discuss these boundary terms below. 

Before doing so, we note that crucial to the validity of the causal set action are its fluctuations in a given causal
set. These were shown in \cite{sorkinnonlocal} to be large for the operator $B$ in $\mink^2$ . This can be traced to the
fact that the elements in $L_k(e)$ for $k=0,1,2,3$ are very close to the discreteness scale and hence the d'Alembertian
is susceptible to  large Poisson fluctuations at small volumes. In order to ``shield'' the continuum from these
fluctuations, a new \emph{mesoscale} $\llk > \lc$ and its associated density $\rk$ %\mnote{All new terms in bold}
was introduced in \cite{sorkinnonlocal}. 
Thus instead of a single discrete operator $B$, we have a one parameter family of
operators:
\begin{equation} 
B_\kappa\phi(e) \equiv \frac{4}{\sqrt{6}}\biggl[-\phi(e)  + \epsilon \sum_{e'\prec e} f(n(e',e), \epsilon) \phi(e')\biggr],  
\label{eq:bkoperator}
\end{equation} 
where $\epsilon \equiv {\rk}/{\rc}$  is a \emph{non-locality parameter},\footnote{$\epsilon$ is a new free parameter in the theory, whose 
value should  ultimately be decided by the fundamental dynamics.} $n(e,e')=|I(e,e')| $ and 
\begin{equation} 
f(n,\epsilon) = (1-\epsilon)^n\biggl[1-\frac{9\epsilon n}{1-\epsilon} +  \frac{8\epsilon^2 n(n-1)}{(1-\epsilon)^2} -
\frac{4\epsilon^3 n(n-1)(n-2)}{3(1-\epsilon)^3} \biggr]. 
\end{equation}   
This function ``smears out'' the contributions of the $N_k$ into four ``layers'' which appear with alternating
sign, as shown in  Fig.~\ref{fne4d.fig}. Each layer is thus thickened from a single value of $k$ to a range of $k$
values depending on $\epsilon$. When this mesoscale matches the discreteness scale, i.e., $\epsilon=1$, each layer
collapses to a single value of $k$.  
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering \resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fne4d}} \hskip 0.1cm 
 %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Layers4d}}
  \caption{The function $f(n,0.05)$. There are 4 regions of alternating sign corresponding to 4
  ``smeared out'' layers.}
\label{fne4d.fig}
\end{figure}
This then gives us a one-parameter family of actions $S_\kappa(C,\epsilon)$, where  $\epsilon$ can be viewed as a tunable
coupling constant.  As we will see in  Sect.~\ref{sec:dynamics}, this gives rise to an interesting phase structure in 2d CST. 


The  result  for $d=2,4$  are due to   \cite{bd,dionthesis} and  were generalised to arbitrary dimensions by \cite{dg,glaser},
using   a dimension dependent smearing function $f_d(n,\epsilon)$.  
 
There have been other attempts to obtain the action of a causal set. In \cite{bomsver}, the curvature at the centre of an
Alexandrov interval $\Alex_d[p,q]$ in a RNN was obtained using the leading order corrections to the volume of a small
causal diamond \citep{gs} 
\begin{equation} 
V=V_0\left(1-\frac{d}{24(d+1)(d+2)} R(0) T^2 + \frac{d}{24(d+1)} R_{00}T^2\right), 
\end{equation} 
where $T$ is the proper time from $p$ to $q$ and $V_0$ is the flat spacetime volume. 
The expression obtained is in terms of the discrete volume and the length of the longest chain from $p$ to $q$.  Since
$R$ is approximately a constant in $\Alex_d[p,q]$,  this also gives the
approximate action.  Extending it to an action on the full spacetime is however quite tricky since it is unclear
how to localise the calculation. 

The calculation for  the abundance of $k$-chains $C_k$ in an RNN  in \cite{rss} also gives an expression for the curvature   
\begin{equation} 
\label{R}
R(0)= 
-{2(n+2)(2n+2)(3n+2)} 2^{\frac{3n+2}{3n}} n^{\frac{4}{3n}-1} \frac{(K_1-2K_2+K_3)}{\,\,\,\,\,(J_1 - 2J_2 +
  J_3)^{\frac{3n+2}{3n}}}.
\end{equation} 
 where 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{moreidentitiestwo}
J_k &\equiv& (kn+2) K_k \nno \\ 
K_k &\equiv& ((k+1)n+2)Q_k, 
\end{eqnarray} and 
\begin{equation} 
Q_k  \equiv  \biggl(\frac{\av{\bC_k}}{\rho^k\zeta_k }\biggr)^{3/k}
=\frac{1}{\wzeta^3}\biggl(\frac{\av{\bC_k}}{\rho^k\chi_k }\biggr)^{3/k}. 
\end{equation} 
While this expression is compact, it is not  defined on a single causal set, but rather, over the ensemble.  Whether this
can be expressed as a function on a single  causal set or not is an interesting open  question and under current
investigation. As in the previous case, having obtained $R(0)$, however, it is non-trivial to construct the action,
without a localisation requirement as was done for the BD action.  



\subsection{Boundary terms for the causal set action} 
\label{ssec:ghy}

Although the BD action gives the bulk Einstein--Hilbert action in the
continuum approximation, the role of boundary terms is less clear. As shown by 
\cite{gaussbonnet} the expectation value for the BD action does not vanish for  $\cC(\Alex_2,\rc)$, where $\Alex_2[p,q]
\subset \mink^2$ as one might expect,
but instead converges to a constant
as $\rc \rightarrow \infty$ and is independent of $\vol(\Alex_2)$.   
\cite{bdjs} showed more generally that  for $\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$ with   $d \geq 2$ that 
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\hbar}\left\langle \tbS_{BDG}^d \right\rangle=  \frac{1}{l_p^{d-2}} \vol
(\mathcal{J}^{(d-2)}) \,,  
\label{result} 
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{J}^{(d-2)} \equiv \partial J^+(p) \cap \partial J^-(q)$ is the co-dimension 2 ``joint'' of the causal
diamond $\Alex_d$, which is a round sphere $S^{d-2}$.  In  $d=2$ this is the volume of a  zero sphere $S^0$ which is the
constant found in 
\citep{gaussbonnet}.  This in turn corresponds to the Gibbons--Hawking--York (GHY) null   boundary term of \citep{jsss,lmps} for a
particular choice of the null affine parameter.\footnote{It is an interesting question whether the choice of affine
  parameter along ``almost''  null directions can be obtained from the causal set.} Extending this calculation to curved spacetime  is 
challenging but would provide additional evidence that the BD action contains the null GHY term ({\it Dhingra, Glaser and
S. Surya, work in progress}).      

Simulations of causal sets corresponding to different regions of $\mink^2$  moreover suggest that while the  BD action contains timelike boundary terms, it does not  contain spacelike boundary terms.  Recent  efforts by \cite{tlbdry}  have been made to obtain 
time like boundaries  in a causal set using numerical methods for $d=2$, but it is an open question whether they admit a simple
characterisation in arbitrary dimensions. 
 
Unlike timelike boundaries, spacelike boundaries are naturally defined in a finite element causal set: a future/past spatial
boundary is the future-most/past-most inextendible antichain in the causal set, which we denote as $\cF_0,\cP_0$
respectively.  GHY terms for spacelike boundaries play an important role in the additivity of the action in the
continuum path integral (though  such an additivity is far from guaranteed in a causal set because of non-locality).

The spatial causal set GHY  terms were found by \cite{bdjs}, and we will describe that construction here briefly. Let
$(M,g)$ be a spacetime with initial and final spatial boundaries $(\Sigma^\pm,h^\pm)$ .  The GHY term on $(\Sigma^\pm,h^\pm)$ can be re-expressed as
\begin{equation} 
\int_{\Sigma^\pm} d^{d-1}x\: \sqrt{h^\pm}\, K^\pm= \frac{\partial}{\partial n}\int_{\Sigma^\pm} d^{d-1}x\: \sqrt{h^\pm}
=\frac{\partial}{\partial n} A_{\Sigma^\pm},
\label{eq:GHYterm}
\end{equation} 
where $\frac{\partial}{\partial n}$ is the normal derivative, and $A_{\Sigma^\pm}$ is the co-dimension $1$ volume of $\Sigma^\pm$. 
Using  the $n\sim \rc v$ correspondence, this suggests that $A_{\Sigma^\pm}$ should be  given by the cardinality 
$\F{0}\equiv |\cF_0|$ or $\P{0}\equiv |\cP_0|$ with the normal gradient represented by the  change in the
cardinality.  But of course this is subtle, 
since  apart from the future most $\cF_0$ or pastmost $\cP_0$ antichains, one needs  another ``close by'' antichain.
Let us focus on $(\Sigma^+,h^+)$ without loss of generality. There are two  ways of finding
this nearby antichain. To begin with if $(M,g) \subset (M',g')$ such that $(\Sigma^+,h^+)$ is not
a boundary in $(M',g')$, then we can use this embedding  to define the two antichains, in any $C \in \cC(N,\rc)$: one to
its immediate past $\cF_0(\Sigma^+)$ and one
to its immediate future $\cP_0(\Sigma^+)$. Thus the GHY term should be proportional to the difference in the cardinality of these two
antichains.  

However, this partitioning is not intrinsic to the causal set. Instead consider a partition  $C = C^-\cup C^+$, such that $C^+\cap C^-=\emptyset$, and $\fut(C^-)=C^+$, $\past(C^+)=C^-$. 
Let $\cF_0^-$ and $\cP_0^+$, be the
future-most and past-most antichains of $C^-$ and $C^+$ respectively.  We can then define the  
dimensionless causal set ``boundary term'' \citep{bdjs}
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm CBT}^d[C,C^-,C^+] \equiv \frac{a_d}{2 \Gamma\left(\frac{2}{d}\right)}\biggl( \F{0}[C^-]-\P{0}[C^+]\biggr),  
\label{eq:cbt} 
\end{equation} 
where
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:Cn}
a_{d}=\frac{d (d+1)}{(d+2)}\left(\frac{\vs_{d-2}}{d(d-1)}\right)^{\frac{2}{d}},
\end{equation} 
and $\vs_d=(d+1)\pi^{\frac{d+1}{2}}/\Gamma\left (\frac{d+1}{2}+1\right)$ is the volume of the unit $d$-sphere.


To make
contact with the continuum, let $(M,g)$ be a spacetime with compact Cauchy hypersurfaces. For a given Cauchy
hypersurface $(\Sigma,h)$ let $M^\pm=J^\pm(\Sigma)$ and let $C^\pm \in \cC(M^\pm,\rc)$.  It was shown by \cite{bdjs} that in
the limit $\rc \rightarrow \infty$ %\mnote{\red{FLAG:whats the limit here?!}}
\begin{equation} 
\negs\negs \lim_{\rc\rightarrow \infty}\left (\frac{\lc}{\lp}\right)^{\! \! d-2}\negs \left\langle\textbf{S}^{
    (d)}_{\rm CBT}[M, \Sigma,\rc]\right\rangle= \frac{1}{l_p^{d-2}}\int_{\Sigma} d^{d-1}x\: \sqrt{h}\: K = {S}_{GHY}(\Sigma,
M^-), \label{eq:ghyresult} 
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{S}^{(d)}_{\rm CBT}$ is the associated random variable in $(M,g)$.  To obtain this expression, the volume  of a
half
cone $J^+(p) \cap J^-(\Sigma)$ was calculated using a combination of RNN coordinates 
and GNN coordinates\footnote{This calculation has later been extended by \cite{jubb} to higher orders to
  obtain more information about the spatial geometry.}
\begin{equation} 
V_\blacktriangle (T,\mathbf x)
=\frac{S_{d-2}}{d(d-1)}T^d\left (1+\frac{d}{2 (d+1)}K (0,\mathbf{x})T\right)
+O (T^{d+2}),   \label{eq:TopVolumeWithK} 
\end{equation}
for $p \in J^+(\Sigma)$  sufficiently close to $\Sigma$, where $T$ is the proper time from $p$ to $\Sigma$. 
As might be expected from dimensional considerations, the leading order correction to the flat spacetime volume of the
half cone comes  from the trace of the extrinsic curvature of $\Sigma$ from which the GHY contribution can be obtained.   
   

If on the other hand, $(\Sigma,h)$ is a future boundary of $(M,g)$, then we require a second
antichain in $\past(\cF_0)$  for $C \in \cC(M,\rc)$,. Define the antichain $\cF_1$ in $C^-$ to
be the set of elements in $C^-$ such that $\forall e \in \cF_1$, $|\fut(e) \cap C^-|=1$ (where $\fut(e)$ excludes the
element $e$).\footnote{Note that while  $\cF_1\cap \cF_0=\emptyset$,  $\cF_1$ is not necessarily an inextendible
  antichain.}  The boundary  term can then be expressed as 
\begin{equation} 
S_{\rm CBT}^d[C,C^-,C^+] \equiv \frac{a_d}{\Gamma\left(\frac{2}{d}\right)}\biggl( d\F{1}[C^-]-\F{0}[C^+]\biggr),  
\label{eq:cbttwo} 
\end{equation} 
which again yields the GHY term Eq.~(\ref{eq:ghyresult})  in the limit. Indeed, a whole  family of  of boundary terms was
obtained using the antichains $\cF_k[C^-] = \{e \in C^-|  |\fut(e)|=k\}$, $\cP_k[C^+]= \{e \in C^+ |
|\past(e)|=k\}$ each of which gives the GHY term in the limit Eq.~(\ref{eq:ghyresult}).\footnote{The expression in \cite{bdjs} holds for \emph{any} two subsets of $C$ not just those we
  consider here.}

A by-product of the analysis of \cite{bdjs} is that for the partitioned causal set $C=C^-\cup C^+$ described above, the quantities 
\begin{equation} 
A_+^d[C^-]\equiv \frac{b_d}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{d})}\F{0}[C^-], \quad A_-^d[C^+]\equiv \frac{b_d}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{d})}\P{0}[C^+]
\end{equation} 
for $a_d=\frac{d+1}{d(d+2)} b_d^2$ limit to the spatial volume of $\Sigma$
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{\lp}{\lc}\right)^{d-2} \av{A_\pm^d[C^\mp]} = \frac{1}{\lp^{d-1}}\int_\Sigma
  d^{d-1} x \sqrt{h} = A_\Sigma. 
\end{equation} 
Again, as for the boundary terms, one can construct a  whole family of functions $A^d[C]$ each of 
which limit to the spatial volume of $\Sigma$ as $\rc \rightarrow \infty$.  
 






\subsection{Localisation in a causal set} 
\label{ssec:localisation} 

In these calculations generalisations are made to curved
spacetime using an RNN which represent a local region of a spacetime.  How are we to find such local regions in a
causal set using a purely order theoretic quantities?  For a causal set  a natural  definition of  a local region
is given by  the size of an interval, but for a manifold-like causal set, this will not necessarily correspond  to regions in
which the curvature is small. On the other hand, many of the order invariants we have obtained so far correspond to
geometric invariants only in such RNN-type regions.

A characterisation of intrinsic localisation was obtained by \cite{intervals}  using the abundance $N_m^d$ of $m$ element order
intervals for $C\in\cC(\Alex_d,\rc)$.  They  found the following closed form expression for the associated
expectation value 
\begin{align}
	\av{\bN_m^d(\rho,V)}=& \frac{(\rho V)^{m+2}}{(m+2)!} \frac{\G{d}^{2}}{\Poch{\frac{d}{2} (m + 1) + 1}{d - 1}} \frac{1}{\Poch{\frac{d}{2} m + 1}{d - 1}} \nonumber \\
	& \mFm{d}{1+m,\frac{2 }
	{d}+m,\frac{4}{d}+m, \dots ,\frac{2 (d-1)}{d}+m)}
	{3+m,\frac{2 }{d}+m+2,\frac{4}{d}+m+2, \dots ,\frac{2 (d-1)}{d}+m+2}
	{- \rho V} \;,
\label{eq:flatclosedform} 
\end{align} 
The distribution of $\av{\bN_m^d}$ with $m$ therefore has a characteristic form which depends on dimension, and as a by-product,
can be used as a  dimension estimator. However, it can also be used look for intervals in a manifold-like causal set
which are approximately flat by comparing the interval abundances $N_m^d$ to the above expression for $\av{\bN_m^d}$.  While one might expect  the fluctuations for a given causal
set $C$ to be  large,  numerical simulations show that there is typically a ``self averaging'' which results in 
 relatively small fluctuations even for a given realisation. This makes it an ideal
diagnostic tool for checking whether a neighbourhood in a manifold-like causal set is approximately flat or not. Once such local
neighbourhoods have  been found, a local check of geometric estimators can be made.

In \cite{intervals}, the analytic curves
were compared  against simulations for a range of different causal sets including those that are not manifold-like . While
curvature affects the abundance of the intervals, the distribution retains its characteristic form. Hence
the dependence of the abundance of intervals with size  also becomes a test for manifold-likeness.

There are other ways of testing for manifold-likeness.  In a similar approach, the distribution of the longest  chains or linked paths of length $k$ in a finite element causal set $C$ has been
studied in $\mink^d$, $d=2,3,4$ and shown to have a dimension-dependent peak \citep{bomemad}. 
 In \cite{nodedegree},  a novel way to test for manifold-likeness was given, using the order invariant obtained from counting
 the number of elements with a fixed valency  in a finite
element causal set. In   \cite{joeinterval},  an  algorithm for  determining  the  embeddability of a causal set in
$\mink^2$ was given,  which
again gives an intrinsic characterisation of manifold-likeness in $d=2$. Extending and expanding on these studies using
causal sets obtained from sprinklings into different types of spacetimes would be a straightforward but useful exercise.      

\subsection{Kinematical entropy} 
\label{ssec:kinent}

Since the classical continuum geometry itself is fundamentally statistical in CST, it is interesting to ask if a
kinematic 
entropy can be assigned even classically to the continuum. In \cite{dousorkin},  a kinematic entropy was associated
with a horizon $H$ and a  spatial or null hypersurface $\Sigma$ in a  dimensionally reduced $d=2$ black hole spacetime by counting links between 
elements in $J^-(\Sigma) \cap J^-(H)$ and those in $J^+(\Sigma) \cap J^+(H)$, with the additional requirement that the
former is future-most and the latter past-most in their respective regions. A dimensionally reduced calculation showed that the number of
links is proportional to the horizon area. Importantly, the  calculation yields the same
constant for a dimensionally reduced dynamical spacetime where  a collapsing shell of null matter eventually forms a
black hole. However, extending this calculation  to higher dimensions proves to be  tricky.  In \cite{sarahthesis}, an entropy
formula was proposed for higher dimensions by replacing links with other sub-causal sets. While these ideas  hold
promise, they  have not as yet been fully explored. 

In analogy with Susskind's entropy bound,  the
maximum causal set entropy  associated with a finite
spherically symmetric spatial hypersurface $\Sigma$  was defined by \cite{rz} as the number of maximal or future most elements
in its future domain of dependence $D^+(\Sigma)$. It was shown  that for several such examples this bound
limits to the Susskind entropy bound in the continuum approximation. Again, extending this discussion to more general
spacetimes is an interesting open question. 

In \cite{dionthesis},  the  mutual information between  different regions of a causal set was defined  using the
BD action. The source of this entropy is non-locality which implies that $S_{BD}$ is not in general additive.  Dividing
a causal set $C$ into two (set-wise) disjoint regions $C_1$ and $C_2$, so that $C=C_1 \sqcup C_2$,  we see that in
general $S_{BD}(C) \neq S_{BD}(C_1) + S_{BD}(C_2)$.  This is because 
there can be order intervals between elements in $C_1$
and in $C_2$ that are not counted by either $S_{BD}(C_1)$ or $S_{BD}(C_2)$. The  mutual information is thus 
defined as
\begin{equation}
  MI[C_,C_2]\equiv S_{BD}(C_1) +S_{BD}(C_2)-S_{BD}(C). 
\end{equation}
In  \citep{dionthesis}  a spacetime region with a horizon $\cH$ and a  spacelike or
null hypersurface $\Sigma$ was considered. Defining $X=J^+(\cH) \cap J^-(\Sigma)$ and $Y=J^-(\cH) \cap J^-(\Sigma)$ the mutual
information between $X$ and $Y$ was calculated from  a causal set obtained from sprinkling  into $X\cup Y$.  Under
certain assumptions, this equal to the area of $\cH\cap \Sigma$. These results are suggestive, but currently incomplete.

As we will see in the next section, the {Sorkin spacetime  entanglement entropy (SSEE)} for a free scalar field provides a
different avenue for exploring entropy.

%{\bf The $\cO$-Hauptvermutung}  

\subsection{Remarks} 

To conclude this section  we note that several order invariants have been constructed on manifold-like causal sets  whose expectation
values limit to manifold  invariants  as $\rc \rightarrow \infty$. At finite $\rc$ there are  
fluctuations that serve to distinguish the fundamental discreteness of causal sets from the continuum, and these have potential
phenomenological consequences.  Numerical simulations are often important in 
assessing the relative importance of these fluctuations. 

For each of these invariants, one has therefore proved an  \emph{$\cO$-Hauptvermutung}.  While this collection of
order invariants is not sufficient to prove   the full Hauptvermutung, they lend it strong support. These order
invariants are moreover important observables for the full theory.   In addition to these
manifold-like order invariants, there are several other order invariants that can be constructed, 
some of which may be important to the deep quantum regime but by themselves hold no direct continuum interpretation.
