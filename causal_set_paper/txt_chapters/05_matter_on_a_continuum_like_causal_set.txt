\section{Matter on a continuum-like causal set}
\label{sec:matter}


Before passing on to the dynamics of CST, we look at a phenomenologically important question, namely how quantum fields
behave on a fixed manifold-like causal set.   The simplest matter field  is the free scalar field on a
causal set in $\mink^d$.  As we noted in the previous Section, this is the only class of matter fields that
we know how to study, since at present no well defined representation of non-trivial tensorial fields on causal sets is
known. However, as we will see, even this very simple class of matter fields  brings with it both exciting new insights and
interesting conundrums.  

\subsection{Causal set Green functions for a free scalar field } 
\label{ssec:Green} 
Consider the real scalar field $\phi: \mink^d \rightarrow \re$ and its CST counterpart,    $\phi:C \rightarrow
\re$  where $C \in \cC(\mink^d,\rc)$. The Klein Gordon  operator of the continuum is replaced on the causal set by the $B_\kappa$ operator
of Sect.~\ref{sec:kinematics}, Eq.~(\ref{eq:bkoperator}).   In the continuum $\Box^{-1}$ gives the Green function, and we can do
the same with $B_\kappa$ to obtain the discrete Green function $B_\kappa^{-1}$.

However, there are more direct ways of obtaining the Green function
as was shown in \cite{daughton,salgado,johnston,dsx}.  The \emph{causal matrix} 
\begin{equation}
C_0(e,e') \equiv
\left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
                1  & \mbox{if } e' \prec e \\
                0 & \mbox{} \mathrm{otherwise}
        \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
on a causal set $C$.    For $C \in \cC(\mink^d,\rc)$,  $C_0(e,.)$ is therefore zero everywhere except within  the past light cone of $e$ at
which it is $1$.  In $d=2$, this is just half the massless retarded Green's function $G^{(2)}_0(x,x') =\frac{1}{2}
\theta(t-t') \theta(\tau^2(x,x'))$.  Hence, we find the almost trivial relation  
\begin{equation} 
\bC_0(x,x') = 2 G^{(2)}_0(x,x'), 
\end{equation} 
without having to take an expectation value, so that  the  dimensionless  massless causal set retarded Green
function is  \citep{daughton}  
\begin{equation}
\label{massless2d}
K^{(2)}_0(x,x')\equiv  \frac{1}{2}C_0(x,x').
\end{equation}

To obtain the $d=4$ massless causal set Green function we use the \emph{link matrix}
\begin{equation}
L_0(x,x'):=
\left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
                1  & \mbox{if } x' \prec x {\mathrm \ is \ a \ link}\\
                0 & \mbox{} \mathrm{otherwise}
        \end{array}
      \right. 
      \label{eq:linkm}
    \end{equation}
  For $C \in \cC(\mink^4,\rc)$ the expectation value of the associated random variable is 
\begin{equation}
\label{linkexp}
\av{\bL_0(x,x')}=\theta(x_0-x'_0) \theta( \tau^2(x,x'))\exp(-\rc V(x,x')),
\end{equation}
where $V(x,x') = \vol(J^-(x) \cap J^+(x')) = \frac{\pi}{24}\tau^4(x,x')$. Since the exponential in the above expression
is a Gaussian which, in the $\rc \rightarrow \infty $ limit  is proportional to $\delta(\tau^2)$, we see that it resembles the
massless retarded Green function in $\mink^4$, 
\begin{equation} 
\label{linklim}
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} {\sqrt{\frac{\rc}{6}}\av{\bL_0(x,x')}} =  \theta(x_0-x_0') \delta(\tau^2) =2 \pi
G^{(4)}_0(x,x'). 
\end{equation} 
Hence we can write the  dimensionless massless causal set scalar retarded Green function as \citep{johnston,johnstonthesis} 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:massless4d}
K^{(4)}_0(x,x')= \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sqrt{\frac{1}{6}} L_0(x,x')\,. 
\end{equation} 

In the continuum the massive Green function can be
obtained from the massless Green function in $\mink^d$ via the formal expression \citep{dsx} 
\begin{equation} 
\label{eq:conv} 
G_m=G_0 - m^2\,G_0*G_0 + m^4 \,G_0*G_0*G_0+ \ldots = \sum_{k=0}^\infty(-m^2)^k \underbrace{G_0 * G_0* \ldots G_0}_{k+1}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
(A\ast B)(x,x')\equiv \int d^dx_1 \sqrt{-g(x_1)} A(x,x_1)
B(x_1,x')\,.
\label{eq:conv}
\end{equation}  
Using this as a template, with the discrete convolution operation given by  matrix multiplication,  
\begin{equation}
(A \ast B)(e,e')\equiv  \sum_{e''} A(e,e'') B(e'',e)\, , 
\end{equation}  
a candidate for the  $d=2$ dimensionless massive causal set Green function is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2dGf} 
K^{(2)}_M(x,x') =  \frac{1}{2} \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \, \frac{M^{2k} }{2^k}  C_k(x,x').   
\end{equation} 
Here $M$ is dimensionless and  we have used the relation $C_k(x,x')=C_0^k(x,x')$, where the product is defined by the
convolution operation Eq.~\ref{eq:conv} and, $C_k(x,x')$ counts the number of
$k$-element chains from $x$ to $x'$.  For $C \in \cC(\mink^2, \rc)$  it can  be shown
that \citep{johnston,johnstonthesis}  
\begin{equation} 
\av{\bK^{(2)}_M(x,x')} = G^{(2)}_m(x,x') \label{proof3}\,, 
\end{equation} 
when $M^2=\frac{m^2}{\rc}$.  
Similarly, a candidate for the $d=4$ massive causal set Green function is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:4dGF}
K^{(4)}_M(x,x') =  \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{6}} \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty
(-1)^k \, \left(\frac{M^2}{2\pi\sqrt{6}}\right)^{k} L_k(x,x')\, ,
\end{equation} 
where we have used the fact that the number of $k$-element linked paths $L_k(x,x')=L_0^k(x,x')$. For  $C \in \cC(\mink^4,\rc)$, 
\begin{equation} 
\lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt{\rc} \av{\bK^{(4)}_M(x,x')} = G^{(4)}_m(x,x')\,, 
\end{equation} 
when  $M^2=\frac{m^2}{\sqrt{\rc}}$. 

These  massive causal set Green function were  first obtained by \cite{johnston,johnstonthesis} using an evocative  analogy between Feynman paths
and the $k$-chains or  $k$-linked paths (see Fig.~\ref{hopstop.fig}). ``Amplitudes'' $a$ and $b$ are  assigned to a  ``hop'' between two
elements in the Feynman path, and to a ``stop'' at an 
intervening element, respectively. This gives a total ``amplitude'' $a^{k+1}b^k$ for each
chain or linked path, so that the massive Green functions can be expressed as  
\begin{equation} 
K_m^{(2)}(e,e') \equiv \sum_{k=0} a_2^{k+1} b_2^{k} C_k(e,e'), \quad K_m^{(4)}(e,e') \equiv \sum_{k=0} a_4^{k+1} b_4^{k}
L_k(e,e'), 
\end{equation}   
where the coefficients $a_d,b_d$ are set by comparing with the continuum.

  \caption{The hop and stop amplitudes $a$ and $b$ on a 2-element chain from $e$ to $e'$ for a massive scalar field on a causal set.}
\label{hopstop.fig} 
\end{figure}

Finding causal set Green functions for other spacetimes is more challenging, but there have been some recent results \citep{dsx}
which show that the flat spacetime form  of \cite{johnston, johnstonthesis} can be used in a wider context. These
include (a) a causal diamond in an RNN of a $d=2$ spacetime with $M^2={\rc}^{-1}({m^2+\xi R(0)})$, where $R(0)$  is the
Ricci scalar at the centre of the diamond and $\xi$ is the non-minimal
coupling,  (b)  a causal diamond in an RNN of a $d=4$ spacetime with $R_{ab}(0)
\propto g_{ab}(0)$ and  $M^2={\rc}^{-1}({m^2+\xi R(0)})$  when (c) $d=4$ de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes with $M^2={\rc}^{-1}({m^2+\xi })$. 

The de Sitter causal set Green function in particular  allows us to  explore cosmological consequences  of  discreteness, one of which
we will describe below.  It would be useful to extend this construction to other conformally flat spacetimes of cosmological relevance like the flat FRW
spacetimes.  Candidates for causal set Green functions in $\mink^3$ have also  been obtained using both the volume of the causal interval and the
length of the longest chain \citep{johnstonthesis,dsx}, but the comparisons with the continuum need
further study. 

% In the continuum, the massless and massive Green functions are related via a curved
% spacetime generalisation of Eq.~(\ref{eq:conv}), which relates the massive scalar Green functions with non-minimal
% coupling $\xi$ with their massless counterparts. In particular, for constant Ricci curvature, the relation extends
% between any two Green functions with $\mu^2$, and we can use this fact in an RNN since $R(x')$ is approximately
% constant to leading order.  Assuming this is also the case for  causal set Green functions,  the massless conformally
% coupled causal set Green function for $d=4$ can be used to construct that for any
% $M^2=\frac{\mu^2}{\sqrt{\rc}}$.    


% For  conformally related spacetimes $g_{ab}=\Omega^2g_{ab}'$,  the  conformally coupled $\xi_c=\frac{d-2}{4(d-1)}$  massless scalar Green
% functions are proportional to each other  
% \begin{equation} 
% G_{0,\xi_c}(x,x') =\Omega(x)^{\frac{2-d}{2}} G_{0,\xi_c}'(x,x')\Omega(x')^{\frac{2-d}{2}}. 
% \end{equation}  
% Since the massless causal set Green function in $\mink^2$ and $\mink^4$ are known, this suggests  a way of obtaining the
% $K^{(2,4)}_{0,\xi}(e,e')$ for a causal set obtained from a  conformally flat spacetime.  The most interesting
% examples of this  are conformally flat  patches of both $d=4$ de Sitter and $d=4$ anti de Sitter  spacetime for which the massless
% conformally coupled massless causal set Green function continues to have the form Eq.~(\ref{eq:massless4d}) and in the
% limit  it can be shown that 
% \begin{equation} 
% \lim_{\rc \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt{\rc} \av{\bK_0(x,x')} = G_{0,\xi_c}^{dS/adS} 
% \end{equation} 
% An ansatz for the non-conformally coupled
% massive causal set Green functions $K_M(e,e')$ can be obtained in analogy with the curved spacetime generalisation of
% Eq.~(\ref{eq:conv}), where $M^2=\frac{\mu^2}{\sqrt{\rc}}$.




As the attentive reader would have noticed, in $d=4$ the causal set Green function matches the continuum only for $\rc
\rightarrow \infty$, unlike in $d=2$. At finite $\rc$,  there  can be potentially observable
differences with the continuum. Comparisons with observation can therefore  put constraints on CST. \cite{dhstwo}  examined
a model for the propagation of a classical massless scalar field from a source to a
detector on a background causal set. In $\mink^d$, an oscillating point source 
with scalar charge $q$, frequency $\omega$ and amplitude $a$, and a ``head-on'' rectangular shaped detector  
was considered, so that the  field produced by the source is 
\begin{equation} 
\phi(y)=\int_P G(y,x(s)) q ds
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal P$ is the world line of the source and $s$ the proper time along this world line. If $\mathcal{D}$ represents the
spacetime volume swept out  by the detector during its detection time $T$ then the output of the detector is 
\begin{equation} 
F= \int_{\mathcal{D}} \phi(y) d^4y= q\int_{\mathcal P} ds \int_{\mathcal{D}} d^4y  G(y,x(s)) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1+\nu}{1-\nu}}
\frac{q}{4 \pi R} v_{\mathcal{D}}
\label{eq:detres}
\end{equation}  
where $R$ is the distance between the source and detector,  $\nu$ is the component of the velocity along the
displacement vector between the source and detector and $v_{\mathcal{D}}$ is the spacetime volume of the detector region
$\mathcal D$. Here, $R>>a$ and  $R >> \omega^{-1}$ which in turn is much larger than  the spatial and temporal extent of the detector region
$\mathcal D$. The causal set detector output can then be defined as 
\begin{equation} 
\tF = q\frac{1}{2\pi \sqrt{6}}\sum_{e \in \tilde{\mathcal P} }\sum_{e' \in \tilde{\mathcal D}}L_0(e',e)
\end{equation}   
where $\tilde{\mathcal D} $ and $\tilde{\mathcal P}$ correspond to the detector and source subregions in the causal set
and the causal set function $L(e,e')$ is equal to some normalisation constant $\kappa$ when $e$ and $e' $ are linked and
is zero otherwise. For $C \in
\cC(\mink^4,\rc) $ it was shown that,  with the above constraints on $R, \omega, a$ and the dimensions of the detector,
that $\av{\btF}$  approximates to  same continuum expression
Eq.~(\ref{eq:detres}) when $R>> \rc^{-\frac{1}{4}}$. A detailed calculation gives an  upper bound  on the
fluctuations, which,  for a particular AGN model is one  part in $10^{12}$ for $\rc=\rp$. Hence the discreteness does not seem to mess
with the coherence of waves from distant sources. As we will see in Sect.~\ref{sec:phen}  there are other potential signatures of the
discreteness that may have phenomenological consequences \citep{swerves,lambdaone,lambdatwo,lambdathree}. 


\subsection{The Sorkin--Johnston (SJ) vacuum} 
\label{ssec:SJ} 
 
Having obtained the classical Green function and the d'Alembertian operator in $\mink^2$ and $\mink^4$, the obvious next step
is to build a full quantum scalar field theory on the causal set. As we have mentioned earlier, the
canonical route to quantisation is not an option for causal sets nor for fields on causal sets and hence there is a need to look at more covariant
quantisation procedures. 

\cite{johnstontwo,johnstonthesis}  used the the covariantly defined {Peierls'}   bracket 
\begin{equation} 
[\hP(x),\hP(y)] = i\Delta(x,y) 
\end{equation} 
as the starting
point for quantisation, where 
\begin{equation} 
\Delta(x,y) \equiv G^R(x,x')-G^A(x,x') 
\end{equation}
is the Pauli Jordan function, and $G^{R,A}(x,x')$ are the retarded and advanced Green's
functions, respectively.  As we have seen,  these Green functions  can be defined on certain manifold-like causal sets and
hence provide a 
natural starting point for quantisation. 

However, even  here, the standard route to quantisation involves the
mode decomposition of the space of solutions of the Klein Gordan operator,  $\ker(\Box-m^2)$.  In $\mink^d$ the space of
solutions has a unique  split  into positive
and negative frequency classes of modes  with respect to which a vacuum can be defined.  
In his quest for a Feynman propagator, \cite{johnstontwo} made a bold proposal, which as we
will describe below,  has led  to a very interesting new direction in quantum field theory  even in the
continuum. This is  the  \emph{Sorkin--Johnston or SJ vacuum} for a free quantum scalar field theory. 

Noticing that the  Pauli--Jordan function on a {finite}  causal set $C$ is a Hermitian operator, and that
$\Delta(e,e')$ itself is antisymmetric,  Johnston used the fact that the eigenspectrum of $i\Delta$ 
\begin{equation}
i \hD \circ \vkpj(e) \equiv \sum_{e'\in C} \,i\Delta(e,e')\vkpj(e')=\lk \vkpj(e)
\end{equation} 
splits into  pairs $(\lk, -\lk)$, with  eigenfunctions $(\vkpjp, \vkpjm)$, $\vkpjm={\vkpjp}^\ast$.  
This provides a natural  split  into a positive part and a negative part, without explicit reference to $\ker(\Box
-m^2)$.\footnote{The identification of $\ker(\Box -m^2)$ with $Im(i\Delta)$ is in fact well known \citep{waldqft} when the latter is
restricted to functions of compact support.} A spectral decomposition of $i\hD$ then gives 
\begin{equation} 
i \Delta(e,e')=\lk\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\vkpjp(e){\vkpjp}^*(e')-\vkpjp(e)^*{\vkpjp}(e').
\label{modeexp} 
\end{equation}
This decomposition is used to define the SJ Wightmann function as the positive part of $i \Delta$ 
\begin{equation} 
W_{SJ}(e,e') \equiv \lk\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\vkpjp(e){\vkpjp}^*(e'). 
\end{equation} 
Importantly, for a non-interacting theory with a  Gaussian state, the Wightmann function is sufficient to describe
the full theory and thus the vacuum state. Simulations in $\mink^d$ for $d=2,4$  give a  good agreement with the
continuum \citep{johnstontwo,johnstonthesis}.     

\cite{sorkinsj}  noticed  that the construction on the causal set, which was born out of necessity, provides a
new way of thinking of the quantum field theory vacuum.  
A well known feature of quantum field theory in a general curved spacetime is that the vacuum obtained from mode decomposition
in  $\ker(\hB-m^2)$ is observer dependent and hence not unique.  Since the  SJ vacuum is intrinsically defined, at least in finite spacetime
regions, one has a uniquely defined vacuum.   As a result, the SJ state has generated some interest in the broader algebraic field theory community
\citep{fv12,bf14,fewsterart}.  For example, while not in itself Hadamard in general, the SJ vacuum  can be used to generate a new class of Hadamard
states \citep{bf14}.

In the  continuum,  the SJ  vacuum was constructed for the  massless scalar field in the $d=2$ causal
diamond \citep{sj2ddiamond} and recently extended to the small mass case \citep{mathursurya}.  It has also been obtained  for the trousers topology and shown to produce a divergent
energy along both the future and the past light cones associated with the Morse point singularity \citep{sjtrousers}.
Numerical simulations of the SJ vacuum on causal sets are are approximated by 
de Sitter spacetime suggest that the
causal set SJ state differs significantly from the Mottola--Allen $\alpha$ vacuua \citep{sxy}.  This has potentially far
reaching observational consequences which need further investigation.  

\subsection{Entanglement entropy} 
\label{ssec:SSEE}
 
 Using
the Pauli Jordan operator $i\hD$ and the associated Wightman  $\hW$, \cite{sorkinEE} defined a spacetime entanglement entropy, \emph{Sorkins' Spacetime Entanglement Entropy (SSEE)} 
\begin{equation} 
S = \sum_{i} \lambda_i \ln|\lambda_i|
\end{equation} 
where $\lambda_i$ are the  generalised eigenvalues satisfying 
\begin{equation} 
\hW\circ v_i = i \lambda_i \hD \circ  v_i. 
\label{eq:genev} 
\end{equation} 
It was shown by \cite{yasamaneecont} that for a  causal diamond  sitting at  the centre of a larger
one  in $\mink^2$, $S$ has the expected
behaviour in the limit that the size of the smaller diamond $l$ is much smaller than that of the larger diamond,    
\begin{equation} 
S=b \ln \left(\frac{l}{l_{uv}}\right) +c, 
\end{equation} 
where $l_{uv}$ is the UV cut-off and $b,c$ are constants that can be determined.  

 
One of the promises that discretisation holds is of curing the UV divergences of quantum field theory and in particular
those coming from  the calculation of the entanglement entropy of \cite{bklsEE}.  As shown by \cite{causetee} the
causal set version of the above calculation is proportional to the volume rather than
the above ``area'', thus differing from the continuum. This can be traced to the fact that the 
continuum spectrum of eigenvalues (Eq.~\ref{eq:genev})  agrees with the discrete eigenvalues only up to a 
``knee'', beyond  which the effects of discreteness become important, as shown in Fig.~\ref{spectrum.fig}.
Using a double truncation of the spectrum -- once in the larger diamond and once in the smaller one, \cite{causetee}
obtained the requisite area law. This raises
very interesting and as yet unanswered puzzles about the nature of SSEE in the causal set. It is for example possible that in a
fundamentally non-local theory like CST an area law is less natural than a volume law. Such a radical understanding could
force us to rethink continuum inspired ideas about Black Hole entropy. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering \resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{eigenvalues_2dcd}} 
  \caption{A log-log plot depicting the SJ spectra  for causal sets in a causal diamond in $\mink^2$. A comparison with the
      continuum (the straight black line) shows that the causal set SJ spectrum matches the continuum in the IR but has
      a characteristic ``knee'' in the UV after which it deviates significantly from the continuum. As the density of the
      causal set increases, this knee shifts to the UV.}
\label{spectrum.fig} 
\end{figure}



Extending the above calculation to actual black hole spacetimes is an important open problem. Ongoing simulations for
causal sets obtained from sprinklings into 4d de
Sitter spacetime show that this double truncation  procedure gives the right de Sitter horizon entropy ({\it Dowker, Surya,
Sumati, X  and Yazdi, work in progress}),
but one first needs to make an ansatz for 
locating  the knee in the causal set $i \Delta$ spectrum. 
 

\subsection{Spectral dimensions}
\label{ssec:specdim}

An interesting direction in causal set theory has been to calculate the spectral dimension of the causal set
\citep{em,diondr,carlipdr}. \cite{carlipdr} has argued that $d=2$ is special in the UV limit, and that several theories of quantum
gravity lead to such a dimensional reduction. In light of how we have presented CST, it seems that
this continuum inspired description must be limited. It is nevertheless interesting to ask if causal sets that
are manifold-like might exhibit such a behaviour around the discreteness scales at which the continuum approximation is
known to break down. As we have seen earlier (Sect.~\ref{ssec:distance}), one such behaviour is discrete asymptotic silence \citep{ems}.

\cite{em} calculated the spectral dimension on a causal set using  a random walk on a finite element causal
set. It was found that in contrast, the dimension at small scales goes up rather than down.
On the other hand, \cite{diondr} showed  that  causal set inspired  non-local d'Alembertians do give a spectral
dimension of $2$ in all dimensions. As we noted in  Sect.~\ref{sec:kinematics},  \cite{carlipdrone}  showed that  dimensional reduction
of causal sets occurs for the Myrheim--Meyer dimension as one goes to smaller scales.  Recently \citep{esvsd}, the spectral dimension
was calculated on a maximal antichain for a causal set obtained from sprinklings into $\mink^d$, $d=2,3$ using the
induced distance function of \cite{esv}. It was seen to decrease at small scales, thus bringing the results closer to
those from other approaches.
