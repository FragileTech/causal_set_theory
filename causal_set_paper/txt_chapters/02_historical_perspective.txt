 \section{A historical perspective}
\label{sec:history} 

One of the most important conceptual realisations that arose from the
special and general theories of relativity in the early part of the 20th century, was that space and
time are part of a single construct, that of spacetime.  At a
fundamental level, one does not exist without the other. Unlike
Riemannian spaces, spacetime has a Lorentzian signature $(-, +,+,+)$ which
gives rise to local lightcones and an associated  global causal
structure. The causal structure $(M,\prec)$ of a  causal spacetime\footnote{Henceforth, we will assume that
  spacetime is causal, i.e., without any closed causal curves.} $(M,g)$ is a partially ordered set or poset, with
$\prec$ denoting the causal ordering on the ``event-set'' $M$.

Causal set theory (CST) as proposed in \cite{blms}, takes the Lorentzian
character of spacetime and the causal structure poset in particular, as a crucial starting point to
quantisation. It is inspired by a long but sporadic history of investigations into
Lorentzian geometry, in which the connections between $(M,\prec)$
and the conformal geometry were eventually established. This history, while not a part of the
standard narrative of General Relativity, is relevant to the sequence
of ideas that led to CST. In looking for a quantum theory of spacetime, $(M,\prec)$ has also been paired with
discreteness, though the earliest ideas on discreteness go back to pre-quantum and pre-relativistic physics. We now give a
broad review of this history. 

The first few decades after the formulation of General Relativity were dedicated to
understanding the physical implications of the theory
and to finding solutions to the field equations. The attitude  towards Lorentzian geometry was mostly 
practical:  it was seen as a simple, though odd,  generalisation
of Riemannian geometry.\footnote{Hence the term
  ``pseudo-Riemannian''.}  There were however early attempts to understand this new geometry and to use causality as a
starting point. Weyl
and Lorentz  (see \citealt{weyl}) used light rays to attempt a
reconstruction of $d $ dimensional Minkowski spacetime {$\mink^d$}, while 
\cite{robbone,robbtwo} suggested an axiomatic framework for
spacetime where the causal precedence on the collection of events was seen to play a critical role.
It was only several decades later, however,  that the mathematical structure of Lorentzian geometry began to be explored more vigorously. 


In a seminal paper titled ``Causality Implies the Lorentz Group'', \cite{zeeman} identified the {chronological poset}
$(\mink^d,\pprec)$ in $\mink^d$, where  {{$\pprec$}} denotes  the  {chronological relation} on the event-set $\mink^d$. Defining a {chronological automorphism}\footnote{Zeeman used the term ``causal'' instead of
 ``chronological'', but we will follow the more modern usage of these terms \citep{HE,Wald}.} $\fca$ of
$\mink^d$ as the chronological poset-preserving bijection
\begin{equation}
 \fca: \mink^d \rightarrow \mink^d, \quad x \, \,\pprec \, \, y \Leftrightarrow \fca(x) \, \,\pprec \, \,\fca(y), \, \, \forall \, \, x,y
 \in \mink^d, 
 \end{equation} 
Zeeman showed that the group of chronological automorphisms $\dca$ is
isomorphic to  the group $\dlor$ 
of inhomogeneous Lorentz transformations and dilations on
$\mink^d$ when $\dm >2$.  While it is simple to see that
the generators of $\dlor$ preserve the chronological structure so that $\dlor \subseteq \dca$, the
converse is not obvious. In his proof Zeeman showed that every $\fca \in \dca$ maps light rays to light rays, such that
parallel light rays remain parallel and moreover that the map is  linear.  In Minkowski spacetime every chronological
automorphism is also a causal automorphism, so a Corollary to Zeeman's theorem is that the group of causal
automorphisms is isomorphic to $\dlor$. This is a remarkable result, since it states that the physical invariants
associated with $\mink^d$ follow naturally from its \emph{causal structure poset} $(\mink^d,\prec)$ where $\prec$
denotes the causal relation on the event-set $\mink^d$.  


\cite{kp} subsequently generalised
Zeeman's ideas to an arbitrary causal spacetime $(M,g)$ where they identified both $(M,\prec)$ and $(M,\pprec)$ with
the event-set $M$,  devoid of the differential and topological structures associated with a
spacetime. They defined an abstract causal space axiomatically, using both 
$(M,\prec)$ and $(M,\pprec)$ along with a mixed
transitivity condition between the relations $\prec$ and $\pprec$, which mimics that in a causal spacetime.




Zeeman's result in $\mink^d$ was then generalised to a larger class of spacetimes by
\cite{hkm} and \cite{malament}. A chronological bijection generalises Zeeman's
chronological automorphism between two 
spacetimes $(M_1,g_1)$ and $(M_2,g_2)$, and is a chronological order preserving bijection, 
\begin{equation}
 \fcb :M_1 \rightarrow M_2, \quad x \, \,\pprec_1 \, \, y \Leftrightarrow \fcb(x) \, \,\pprec_2 \, \,\fcb(y), \, \, \forall \, \, x,y \in
 M_1, 
\end{equation}
where $\pprec_{1,2}$ refer to the chronology relations on $M_{1,2}$, respectively. 
The existence of a chronological bijection between two strongly causal spacetimes\footnote{A point $p$ in a spacetime is
  said to be strongly causal if every neighbourhood of $p$ contains a subneighbourhood such that no causal curve
  intersects it more than once. All the events in a  strongly causal spacetime are strongly causal.} was equated by  \cite{hkm} to the
existence of a {conformal isometry}, which is a bijection $f:M_1\rightarrow M_2 $ such that $f, f^{-1}$ are smooth (with
respect to the manifold topology and differentiable structure) and $f_*g_1=\lambda g_2$ for a real, smooth, strictly positive function
$\lambda $ on $M_2$. \cite{malament}  then generalised this result to the larger class of \emph{future and past
 distinguishing}  spacetimes.\footnote{These are spacetimes in which the
chronological past and future $I^\pm(p)$ of each event $p$ is unique,
i.e., $I^\pm(p)=I^\pm(q) \Rightarrow p=q$.} 
We refer to these results collectively as the Hawking--King--McCarthy--Malament theorem or \emph{HKMM} theorem, summarised as 

\begin{theorem} {\bf Hawking--King--McCarthy--Malament (HKMM)} \\
If a chronological bijection $\fcb$ exists between two $\dm$-dimensional spacetimes which are both future and
past distinguishing, then these spacetimes are conformally isometric when $\dm>2$. \label{HKMM}
\end{theorem} 


It was shown by  \cite{levichev} that a causal bijection implies a
chronological bijection and hence the above theorem can be generalised
by replacing ``chronological'' with ``causal''. Subsequently \cite{ps} showed that the causal structure poset
$(M,\prec)$ of these spacetimes also contains information about the spacetime dimension. 

Thus, the causal structure poset $(M,\prec)$ of a future and past distinguishing spacetime is
equivalent its conformal geometry.  This means that $(M,\prec)$
is equivalent to the spacetime, except for the local volume  element encoded in the conformal
factor $\lambda$, which is a single scalar. As phrased by \cite{finkelstein}, the causal structure in $d=4$ 
is therefore $\left(9/10\right)^{\mathrm{th}}$ of the metric! 

En route to a theory of quantum gravity one must pause to ask:
what ``natural''  structure of spacetime  should be quantised? Is it the metric  or is it the causal structure poset?  The
former can be defined for all signatures,  but the latter is  an
exclusive  embodiment  of a causal Lorentzian spacetime. In Fig.~\ref{nonlor.fig}, we show a 3d projection of a  non-Lorentzian and
non-Riemannian $d=4$ ``space-time'' with  signature $(-,-,+,+)$. The fact that a time-like direction can be
continuously transformed into any other while still remaining time-like means that there is no order  relation in the space and
hence no associated causal structure poset. We can thus view  the  causal structure poset as an essential  embodiment of  Lorentzian spacetime.  

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering \resizebox{4in}{!}{\includegraphics{othersignature}}
\caption{An example of a signature $(-,-,+,+)$ spacetime with one spatial dimension suppressed. It is
    not possible to distinguish a  past from a  future timelike direction and hence order events,  even locally.}
\label{nonlor.fig}
\end{figure}


Perhaps the first explicit  statement of intent to quantise the {causal structure} of spacetime, rather than the
spacetime geometry was  by \cite{kp},
who listed, as one of their motivations for axiomatising the causal structure:
\begin{quote}
\textit{``To admit structures which can be very different from a
  manifold. The possibility arises, for example, of a locally
  countable or discrete event-space equipped with causal relations macroscopically similar to those of a space-time continuum.''
}
\end{quote}  


This brings to focus  another historical thread of ideas 
important to CST, namely that  of spacetime discreteness.   
The idea  that  the  continuum is a  mathematical
construct which approximates an underlying physical discreteness was already
present in the writings of Riemann as he ruminated on the physicality of the continuum \citep{Riemann}:
\begin{quote}
\textit{``Now it seems that the empirical notions on which the metric determinations of  Space are based, the concept of a
  solid body and that of a light ray; lose their validity in the infinitely small; it is therefore quite definitely
  conceivable that the metric relations of Space in the infinitely small do not conform to the hypotheses of  geometry;
  and in fact one ought to assume this as soon as it permits a simpler way of explaining phenomena.''} 
\end{quote}

Many years later, in their explorations of spacetime and quantum theory, Einstein and Feynman
each questioned the physicality of the continuum \citep{Einstein,Feynman}.  
These ideas were also expressed in Finkelstein's  ``spacetime code'' \citep{finkelstein}, and most relevant to CST, in
Hemion's use of \emph{local finiteness},   to obtain discreteness in the causal
structure poset 
\citep{hemion}.  This last condition is the  requirement there are only a finite number of fundamental spacetime 
elements  in any finite volume  \emph{Alexandrov interval} $\Alex[p,q]\equiv I^+(p)\cap I^-(q)$. 



Although these ideas of spacetime discreteness resonate with the appearance of discreteness in quantum theory, 
the latter  typically manifests itself as  a discrete spectrum of  a continuum observable. The discreteness
proposed above is different: one is replacing the fundamental degrees of
freedom, \emph{before} quantisation, already  at the kinematical
level of the theory. 


The most immediate motivation for discreteness however comes from the HKMM theorem itself.  The missing
$\left(1/10\right)^{\mathrm{th}}$ of the $d=4$ metric is the volume element. A discrete causal set can supply this volume
element by substituting the continuum volume with cardinality. 
This idea was already present in Myrheim's remarkable (unpublished)  CERN preprint \citep{myrheim}, which contains many  of the main  ideas of CST. Here he states:
\begin{quote}
\textit{``It seems more natural to regard the metric as a statistical property of discrete spacetime. Instead we
  want to suggest that the concept of absolute time ordering, or causal ordering of, space-time points, events, might
  serve as the one and only fundamental concept of a discrete space-time geometry. In this view space-time is nothing
  but the causal ordering of events.''}  
\end{quote}

The statistical nature of the poset is a key proposal that survives into CST with the  spacetime continuum emerging 
via a random Poisson sprinkling. We will see this explicitly in Sect.~\ref{sec:cst}. Another key concept which plays a
role in the dynamics is that the
order relation replaces coordinate time and any evolution of spacetime takes meaning only in this intrinsic sense
\citep{lambdatwo}. 


There are of course many other motivations for spacetime discreteness. One of the expectations from a theory of quantum gravity is
that the Planck scale will introduce a natural cut-off which cures both  the UV divergences of quantum field theory and
regulates black hole entropy. The realisation of this hope lies in the details of a given discrete theory, and CST
provides us a concrete way to study this question, as we will discuss in Sect.~\ref{sec:matter}.  %Conversely, there are potential observational signatures of
                                %discreteness. In CST the most striking is the 1987 prediction of the cosmological
                                %constant $\Lambda$ which arises from the specific nature of the CST continuum approximation \cite{lambdaone,lambdatwo}. 






It has been 31 years  since the original CST proposal of BLMS \citep{blms}. The early work shed
considerable  light on key aspects of the theory \citep{blms,bommeyer,bg} and resulted in  Sorkin's prediction of the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$ 
\citep{lambdaone}.  There was a seeming  hiatus in the 1990s, which ended  in the early 2000s
with  exciting  results from the Rideout--Sorkin  classical sequential growth  models \citep{csgone,csgtwo,csgrg,davidthesis}.
%which also  attracted the attention of mathematicians \cite{grnick}.
There have been several non-trivial results  in CST in the intervening 19 odd years.  In the following sections we will
make a broad sketch of the theory and its key  results,  with this historical perspective in
mind.
